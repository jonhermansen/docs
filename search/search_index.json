In following glossary we would like to explain most used terms from Dasharo Documentation. We try to refer to standards, literature and community best practices to keep content added by us minimalistic. Embedded Firmware We use definition explained in first chapter of \"Embedded Firmware Solutions\" book by Jiming Sun, Marc Jones, Stefan Reinauer and Vincent Zimmer. Firmware is \"layer of software between the hardware and the operating system (OS), with the main purpose to initialize and abstract enough hardware so that the operating systems and their drivers can further configure the hardware to its full functionality.\" Rising complexity of hardware initialization and need for its manageability created need for BMC (Board Management Controllers), EC (Environmental Controllers) and even more specialized one like USB Power Delivery firmware. What may make that firmware also covered by above definition. Dasharo Hardware Compatibility List Report Dasharo HCL Report dumps most important information about platform and backup SPI NOR flash. Gathered information can be used for future analysis, debugging and recovery. Optionally scripts upload dump to Dasharo HCL Backup Server, so Dasharo Team can improve open source firmware product line and support customers in case of issues. As temporary solution we use 3mdeb NextCloud as Dasharo HCL Backup Server. Dasharo HCL Reports are also used during open source firmware port feasibilty analysis, so if you are interested in Dasharo support for your hardware, feel free to reach us . Please note Dasharo HCL Report may contain sensitive information like serial numbers. Please do not make this information public. Dasharo Team respect your privacy. Dasharo Blobs Transmission Unfortunately, some hardware platforms cannot be fully functional without binary blobs in the firmware. Some binary blobs have no EULA or any other license discussing redistributability. To avoid issues, Dasharo Blobs Transmission scripts extract blobs from SPI NOR flash backup and patch Dasharo open-source firmware distribution before initial deployment.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"After years of providing services and products on firmware market we recognize that it is poisoned by incorrect and confusing terminology.

Docker coreboot needs a specific toolchain to be built, hence why it is usually built inside of a Docker. In case of Dasharo, all images are built using Docker, so you will make sure it works properly on your system. Follow these two links: Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu Post-installation steps for Linux Once you have Docker set up on your machine, you can pull docker images from coreboot/coreboot-sdk (keep in mind that some platforms require older docker images). To pull a Docker image, use: docker pull coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag> The typical procedure to build a coreboot image is as follows: git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/coreboot.git cd coreboot git checkout <platform>/release docker run -u $UID --rm -it \\ -v $PWD :/home/coreboot/coreboot -w /home/coreboot/coreboot coreboot/coreboot-sdk:<tag> \\ bash cp configs/config.<platform> .config make olddefconfig make Dasharo Contribution All code review and all issues related to Dasharo are resolved on GitHub . An account there is necessary to contribute and report issues. All Dasharo repositories can be found here . When you have an account on GitHub go ahead and configure an SSH key . It's also highly recommended to configure a GPG key before contributing anything. Instructions to do that can be found here . With that your account should be ready to contribute to Dasharo. Since Dasharo is based on coreboot and edk2, it's best to contribute directly in the upstream if possible. Refer to these documents: contributing to coreboot contributing to edk2 If for some reason you can't contribute your change in upstream repositories, then consider contributing directly to Dasharo. Before doing anything it's best to get familiar with source code structure . To create a patch: fork the repository which you want to edit, in the forked repository: git checkout <platform>/develop (make sure to start from the correct branch), create a new branch: git checkout -b <platform>/<feature> , commit your changes: make sure to sign your commits by using git commit -sm \"<commit_message>\" , <commit_message> should be: path/to/file: Change description , one commit should be one logical change, create a pull request from a fork . Dasharo Matrix Space Matrix is a communicator used at Dasharo. If you want quick answers it's best to join our matrix space and talk to us there. Dasharo Matrix Space If you've never used Matrix before, you will first need to get a client. Available clients are listed here .","title":"New?

Press R to rerun test cases, or F to finish. After all, paths to the test results should be displayed in the terminal. By default, they are placed in /home/user/.local/share/checkbox-ng . Additional options run lets you run a particular test plan or a set of jobs, but it does save any results. Example of running one test plan: sudo checkbox-cli run com.canonical.certification::smoke launcher command lets you customize the checkbox experience. To use it, you need to create config_file.ini and start running the checkbox like below: checkbox-cli launcher config_file.ini For more details about these (and others) commands visit checkbox-cli . Troubleshooting When somehow the checkbox stop working you can resume the previous session. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command: sudo checkbox-cli If at least one incomplete session is present on the machine, you should see: Do you want to resume session 'session_title-2022-07-06T13.09.22' ? r = > resume this session n = > next session c = > create new session d = > delete old sessions [ rncd ] : Type in r to resume the stopped session. You can also create a new session or delete an old session by typing the appropriate letter. What do you want to do with that job? s = > skip that job p = > mark it as passed and continue f = > mark it as failed and continue r = > run it [ spfr ] : Decide what you want to do with the last test and type the appropriate letter. After this, your checkbox session will be resumed.","title":"Checkbox certification software usage"},{"location":"common-coreboot-docs/checkbox/#checkbox-certification-software-usage-ubuntu-2204","text":"","title":"Checkbox certification software usage (Ubuntu 22.04)"},{"location":"common-coreboot-docs/checkbox/#introduction","text":"Checkbox is a flexible test automation software.

Disable it if you need access to whole flash with flashrom. Enable SMM BIOS write protection - when enabled, allows only SMM code (the privileged code installed by the firmware in the system memory) to write to BIOS flash. Recommended to be enabled if Firmware setup password is set. Disable the protection if you need access to flash with flashrom. Boot menu enabled - enables/disables ability to enter boot manager menu. Enabled by default. Can be disabled, to prevent from booting from non-default boot media. Early boot DMA Protection - Enables IOMMU DMA protection early during POST. DMA protection is a feature that utilizes the IOMMU early in the boot process to prevent rogue DMA-capable devices such as PCIe add-in cards, USB4/thunderbolt devices from access to memory. This prevents a class of DMA attacks that allow for exfiltration of secrets and installation of malware early in the boot process. Keep IOMMU enabled when transfer control to OS - (only available when Early boot DMA Protection is selected) Keeps IOMMU DMA protection enabled during ExitBootServices when control is passed to the OS. If unsure or see any problems with DMA/IOMMU during OS boot, keep it disabled. NOTE: Windows may not boot if the option is enabled. Networking Options Enable network boot - the option controls if the network boot should be enabled or not. This option is disabled by default on most Dasharo supported devices. When disabled, it prevents loading network controller drivers and unregisters iPXE as boot option (iPXE disappears from Boot Manager and One Time Boot menus) USB Configuration Enable USB stack - controls loading of UEFI USB drivers, when enabled all USB drivers are loaded making USB keyboards and mass storage drives functional in the firmware (to browse setup, press hotkeys or move around bootloaders like GRUB). If disabled no USB device will work before OS is loaded (firmware will not communicate with USB devices). Enable USB Mass Storage driver - this option is blocked if USB stack is disabled. If disabled, UEFI USB Mass Storage driver is not loaded and one cannot boot from USB drives. Essentially this option controls the USB boot capability. It does not affect other devices, like USB keyboards. Intel Management Engine Options This submenu is used to access Intel Management Engine related options. Currently the only option available is Intel ME mode which allows to enable or disable Management Engine: On the right side of the window there is a help section describing the option meaning. If the window is too small, the help section may be divided and not fully shown on the screen. To scroll the help section use D or d keys to scroll down and U or u to scroll up. Intel ME can be disabled in two ways: Disabled (Soft) - when set, causes the Dasharo firmware to send ME_DISABLE command via MEI/HECI. MEI/HECI interface is being hidden from OS when ME is disabled. Disabled (HAP) - when set, causes the Dasharo firmware to set HAP bit in the flash descriptor. MEI/HECI interface is being hidden from OS when ME is disabled. HAP method is much more efficient as it halts the ME firmware execution even earlier than Soft Disable described above When the mode is set to Enabled , Dasharo enables the Intel Management engine by either sending ME_ENABLE command via MEI/HECI or clearing the HAP bit in flash descriptor, depending on the previously active ME mode. MEI/HECI device should be functional in OS when ME is enabled. Any change in the Dasharo firmware setup requires saving the changes and a platform reset (unless specified otherwise). For more information about neutering and disabling ME see also me_cleaner . NOTE: me_cleaner is not supported on all platforms! If a platform supports me_cleaner (i.e. ME version is lower or equal 11.x) it is recommended to set HAP bit and clean the ME region with me_cleaner script permanently. Chipset Configuration The submenu contains general chipset options. Currently available options: Enable PS/2 controller - enables/disables PS/2 controller on the platform. When disabled PS/2 keyboards and mice will stop working in firmware and OS. PS/2 controller will not be functional in OS. This option is not available on laptops where PS/2 is used for the integrated keyboard and possibly touchpad. Enable watchdog - controls the chipset watchdog functionality. If enabled, watchdog will be counting with the timeout specified below. The firmware automatically kicks the watchdog periodically so even without OS support, the platform will not reset itself when watchdog expires. Watchdog timeout value - watchdog timeout in seconds. Allowed range is 60-1024 seconds. The Option is only visible if watchdog is set to enabled. Power Management Options The submenu contains general power management options. Currently available options: Fan profile - Sets of the fan operation modes (defaults to Silent ): Silent - the fan will operate at lower speeds to reduce noise, Performance - the fan will operate at higher speeds, to allow for increased performance.","title":"Dasharo System Features"},{"location":"dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#dasharo-system-features","text":"When entering the Dasharo System Features menu, one may see the following submenus to appear:","title":"Dasharo System Features"},{"location":"dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#dasharo-security-options","text":"This menu offers security-sensitive options like: BIOS boot medium lock - enables/disables flash protection on the vboot recovery firmware partition.

From the main page one may access all menus and submenus available in the firmware setup. Besides the menus there is also an option to: Change the language (currently only English is supported) Continue - execute the top first boot order priority Reset - resets the platform. The currently available menus/submenus are as follows: User Password Management - allows to set firmware setup password Device Manager - allows configuring various devices and features like: UEFI Secure Boot, TPM device, SATA and TCG OPAL password, etc. It may also contain informational menus like Driver Health Manager, Network Device List and others. Dasharo System Features - contains submenus for features specific to Dasharo products and Dasharo supported platforms One Time Boot - allows to choose which boot entry to execute. It simply lists all available boot options and allows to select one the same way as Boot Manager Menu Boot Maintenance Manager - allows to manipulate various UEFI standard variables responsible for console and boot options. One may choose which devices should be used for input and output, choose to boot an arbitrary file or modify the boot options and boot order. NOTE: not all submenus may be available on your platform. Contact Dasharo Team for more information and possible feature extension of your platform. User Password Management User Password Management menu allows one to set firmware setup admin password: The password must be a strong one. The requirements are described on the help section on the right side of the menu page. If the password is too weak it will not be accepted. Also the new password must be different from the last 5 passwords that were used before. The page shows the current status of Admin Password if it is provisioned or not. To disable the password, enter the User Password Management menu again and request to set new password. You will be asked to enter current password. When a window to provide new password pops up, leave the field empty and confirm it twice with ENTER . The password installation status on the menu page should change to Not Installed . One Time Boot When setup application is entered, one of the menus is called One Time Boot . As the name suggests it allows to override the boot just one time (not permanently). The usage principles are the same as for Boot Manager Menu . Example view of One Time Boot submenu: On the right side of the menu window, there is a DevicePath which is a UEFI-compliant path to the device or file being executed. Depending on the file/device type, these paths may be different: DevicePaths are defined in UEFI Specification . If you are interested in decoding those, read through the specification carefully. Boot Manager Menu Boot Manager Menu is an application that lists all bootable options and allows one to override the boot path.

Please do not use DTS v1.1.0 to deploy Dasharo on MSI PRO Z690-A (WIFI) DDR5; otherwise, you will brick your hardware. There are at least two bugs that have to be fixed before it is possible: Power off problem Unsupported mainboard flashing problem . Running The Dasharo Tools Suite can be started in various ways. Currently, there are two options: bootable over a network (iPXE), bootable USB stick image. The first one should always be preferred if possible, as it is the easiest one to use. Bootable over a network This section describes how to boot DTS using iPXE. Requirements Below are the requirements that must be met to run DTS over a network on the platform: Dasharo device with DTS functionality integrated, wired network connection, Secure Boot disabled , disabled BIOS lock feature (if device is already flashed with Dasharo). Launching DTS To access Dasharo Tools Suite: attach a wired network cable to the device's Ethernet port, power on the device, holding down the Boot Menu entry key, in the Boot Menu, select the iPXE Network Boot option, in the Network Boot menu, select the Dasharo Tools Suite option, the DTS menu will now appear. Bootable USB stick This section describes how to boot DTS using a USB stick. Requirements Below are the requirements that must be met to run DTS from a USB device on the platform: USB stick (at least 2GB), wired network connection, Secure Boot disabled , disabled BIOS lock feature (if device is already flashed with Dasharo), latest image from releases section. Launching DTS To access Dasharo Tools Suite: flash the downloaded image onto USB stick, you can use a cross-platform GUI installer - Etcher you can also use dd to flash from the command line gzip -cdk dts-base-image-v1.1.0.wic.gz | \\ sudo dd of = /dev/sdX bs = 16M status = progress conv = fdatasync Note: this is an example done on the v1.1.0 image. insert the USB stick into a USB in your device, boot from the USB stick, the DTS menu will now appear. Building We choose Yocto Project to prepare Dasharo Tools Suite system. DTS image can be built using publicly available sources. Thanks to publishing the build cache on cache.dasharo.com the time needed to finish the process should be significantly decreased. Prerequisites The following must be met to build DTS: Linux PC (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ), docker installed, kas-container 3.0.2 script downloaded and available in PATH , wget -O ~/bin/kas-container https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/3.0.2/kas-container chmod +x ~/bin/kas-container meta-dts repository cloned. mkdir yocto && cd yocto git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/meta-dts.git Build From yocto directory, run: SHELL = /bin/bash kas-container build meta-dts/kas.yml Image build takes time, so be patient, and the build's finished, you should see something similar to (tasks number may differ): Initialising tasks: 100 % | ###########################################################################################| Time: 0:00:01 Sstate summary: Wanted 2 Found 0 Missed 2 Current 931 ( 0 % match, 99 % complete ) NOTE: Executing Tasks NOTE: Tasks Summary: Attempted 2532 tasks of which 2524 didn ' t need to be rerun and all succeeded.

Image created with kas-uefi-sb.yml configuration file enable integration of UEFI Secure Boot into DTS using meta-secure-core . Building the image allow to prepare a PoC version with uses sample keys which by no mean should used in production. For user keys the script [create-user-key-store.sh](https://github.com/jiazhang0/meta-secure-core/blob/master/meta-signing-key/scripts/create-user-key-store.sh can be used but it was not tested yet. Quick start with instructions on how to use image are described in meta-efi-secure-boot . Flash Find out your device name. fdisk -l output: ( ... ) Device Boot Start End Sectors Size Id Type /dev/sdx1 * 8192 131433 123242 60 ,2M c W95 FAT32 ( LBA ) /dev/sdx2 139264 186667 47404 23 ,2M 83 Linux In this case the device name is /dev/sdx , but be aware, in the next steps, replace /dev/sdx with the right device name on your platform, or else you can damage your system! From where you ran image build type. sudo umount /dev/sdx* cd build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64 Here the file dts-base-image-genericx86-64.wic.gz should be available, which is the image of DTS. To flash image, you can use the same command shown in running section . Just change the file name. Boot the platform. Disabling Secure Boot Any procedure affecting the firmware flashing should be preceded by controlling the Secure Boot status and if it is turned on, turning it off. The enabled Secure Boot will not only prevent you from operating on the firmware, but you will also not be able to launch DTS. To check the Secure Boot state: Turn off the station on which you want to test the Dasharo firmware. Turn the station on and go to the next step immediately. Hold the BIOS SETUP KEY to enter the BIOS MENU . Localize and enter the Secure Boot menu using the arrow keys and Enter. Verify that the Secure Boot Status field says Disabled - if not, deselect the Enforce Secure Boot option using the arrow keys and Enter. Change the setting of Secure Boot to Disabled and press Enter. Press the F10 key to open the dialog box. Press Enter to confirm changes and exit from the menu. After completing the steps described above, Secure Boot should be disabled. You could confirm that by repeating steps 3 - 5. Features This section describes the functionality of the Dasharo Tools Suite. These are: Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment , HCL Report , Firmware update , EC transition , EC update , additional features , run commands from iPXE shell , run DTS using VentoyOS . Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment DTS can be used to flash Dasharo firmware on your hardware. To achieve this, boot DTS, choose option number 2 . After creating report with firmware dump as backup, type p to confirm the installation of Dasharo firmware. Next you will be asked two questions to confirm flashing. The first will be displayed with the detected information about the device you are using DTS on. The second will also provide the hash of Dasharo components which will then be used for flashing. You can compare them with the values listed in the supported hardware section on docs.dasharo.com. Both these questions can be accepted by typing Y . Procedure execution ends automatically on the reboot of the platform (unless it requires otherwise). After restarting the device, you can enjoy the basic version of Dasharo, which we provide for given hardware. This feature is supported on the following platforms: ASUS KGPE-D16, Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010, MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4, NovaCustom NV4x, NovaCustom NS5x/7x. HCL Report DTS allows the generation of a package with logs containing hardware information. To create one, choose option number 1 and check out the disclaimer. If you would like to send the report to our servers, please remember about connecting the ethernet cable. More information can be found in glossary . HCL Report correctness Please note DTS HCL Report assumes that your chipset is already supported by flashrom. There are also other false negative errors and unknowns, which we trying to fix to improve user experience. Always check results file to confirm the quality of your HCL report. Sample content of such file may look as follows: [OK] PCI configuration space and topology [UNKNOWN] USB devices and topology [OK] Super I/O configuration [UNKNOWN] EC configuration [ERROR] MSRs [OK] SMBIOS tables [OK] BIOS information [OK] CMOS NVRAM [UNKNOWN] Intel configuration registers [OK] GPIO configuration C header files [OK] kernel dmesg [OK] ACPI tables [UNKNOWN] Audio devices configuration [OK] CPU info [OK] I/O ports [OK] Input bus types [OK] Firmware image [OK] I2C bus [UNKNOWN] ACPI tables [OK] Touchpad information [OK] DIMMs information [ERROR] CBMEM table information [ERROR] TPM information [ERROR] AMT information [OK] ME information Results of getting data: Legend: [OK] Data get successfully [UNKNOWN] Result is unknown [ERROR] Error during getting data Please report all errors experienced while performing a dump to dasharo-issues repository. BIOS backup One of the key components of HCL Report is your BIOS backup. To prepare BIOS backup of your platform, simply run HCL Report and decide if you would like to contribute information about your hardware configuration. Please consider the following options depending on your situation: YES - If you decide to contribute, you can always get back to us and ask about BIOS backup, which we will provide after simple verification that you are the owner of the hardware. NO (default) - If you decide to not contribute, your situation depends on the boot method you used to execute DTS: Network Boot - please note that Dasharo booted over iPXE assumes no storage available, so the report, and your BIOS backup are stored in temporary memory and will not be available after reboot. Please make sure to move HCL Report to not volatile storage. This can be done using option 9) Shell , USB Boot - HCL Report and BIOS backup are saved to USB storage root directory. Firmware update Note: described below functionality is now in testing, available in v1.1.2-dev that can be booted via iPXE . DTS can be used to update Dasharo firmware. To achieve this, boot it on platform with flashed Dasharo and choose option number 5 . Next you will be asked two questions to confirm flashing.

Run commands from iPXE shell It is possible to execute the bash script after Linux startup by passing it from the iPXE shell. Every script placed in /sbin/ipxe-commands will be executed automatically after startup. Here is a simple instruction on how to use that feature. Run the HTTP server in the directory which contains the DTS base image. If you build it by yourself, then it should be the meta-dts subdirectory: build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64 . The easiest way to start an HTTP server is using http.server python module. $ python3 -m http.server 9000 Create a dts.ipxe bootchain file in a directory where you have an HTTP server. That file should have similar content (you need to enter the IP of your host machine in a local network). #!ipxe # kernel http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/bzImage root = /dev/nfs initrd = http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz initrd http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz module http://<YOUR_IP>:9000/custom-script /sbin/ipxe-commands mode = 755 boot Copy your custom-script script in this same directory. Enter the iPXE shell on your device and load dts.ipxe bootchain file. iPXE> dhcp Configuring ( net0 00 :0d:b9:4b:49:60 ) ...... ok iPXE> route net0: 192 .168.4.126/255.255.255.0 gw 192 .168.4.1 iPXE> chain http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts.ipxe http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts.ipxe... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/bzImage... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/dts-base-image-genericx86-64.cpio.gz... ok http://192.168.4.98:9000/custom-script... ok Now your custom-script script should be copied to DTS rootfs as ipxe-commands and will be executed after boot. Run DTS using VentoyOS Starting from version v1.1.1 , we provide also an ISO formatted image. Thanks to that, it can be used with VentoyOS[1]. As for now the following limitations are known. VentoyOS needs to be started in UEFI mode. Nothing can be saved on root file system, as VentoyOS boots systems in read-only mode. Please let us know if you started DTS using VentoyOS and have additional information for us. You can share them on Dasharo Matrix Workspace .","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#documentation","text":"","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"dasharo-tools-suite/documentation/#supported-hardware","text":"Dasharo Tools Suite was prepared to run on x86 platforms, but we can confirm that it boots on the following platforms: ASUS KGPE-D16, Dell OptiPlex 7010/9010, MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 ( test report ), MSI PRO Z690-A DDR5 ( test report ), NovaCustom NV4x ( test report ), NovaCustom NS5x/7x ( test report ).

To check the Secure Boot state: Turn off the station on which you want to test the Dasharo firmware. Turn the station on and go to the next step immediately. Hold the BIOS SETUP KEY to enter the BIOS MENU . Localize and enter the Secure Boot menu using the arrow keys and Enter. Verify that the Secure Boot Status field says Disabled - if not, deselect the Enforce Secure Boot option using the arrow keys and Enter. Change the setting of Secure Boot to Disabled and press Enter.

It is a set of general rules and tips that you should have in mind while writing guides to any projects in Dasharo repositories. Table of content General rules Document type Useful tools Formatting General rules Make a plan - before starting a new document, you should know how it will look. It is good to prepare a table of content first, and then fill up planned chapters. Read twice before publish - everyone make mistakes. Before committing your changes, it is good to read this again and make sure that you do not make any typos, a dump of commands output is correct, or there are no other mistakes. Goal of document - Documentation is not written for everyone. Some documents contain only a list of commands with minor descriptions, some of them were created to describe research results, and others may be written for non-technical persons with a huge amount of data that are obvious and unnecessary to read by developers. Because of that, you should always know for who you are writing that document - it may be developers, testers, or non-technical management. Hierarchy of information - most important information should always be on top of the document. We should start with the title, short description, and table of contexts. The rest of the chapters should start with the most important one. 30/90 rule - It is good to ask your reporter or someone else to do a quick review where approx 30% of the work was done. At this moment, you probably have prepared the initial draft of the document with a table of content and some remarks about content in planned chapters. The second review should be done when 90% of the work is finished, and the document is almost done. With that workflow, you can make sure that you are on the same page with a reporter. Existing resources - We should not duplicate content that was previously described in another document. Some steps or explanations are related to a few documents, and it is not necessary to write the same again. It is good to use references to existing documents (like hyperlinks) - because of that, updating and maintenance of documentation are easier because the change in one document is related to several others. Also, if you see that a related document is outdated, it will be a much better choice to review and update them instead of writing another new one from scratch. Maintenance - documentation may be outdated after a few changes. We should keep that in mind and prepare an updated schedule. One of the ideas is to mark related documents in every pull request with technical changes. Of course, the best solution is to improve documentation with every change in code/architecture, but it is not always possible due to deadlines or lack of time. Marking documents to update in the future allows us to do that on better occasions - and we prevent situations where the reader must inform us that the documentation is highly outdated - or even useless. Archive - Projects are changing, and some topics from the past are not existing now. If the document describes the working of a non-existing mechanism, we should move it to the special folder with archived content. We can go back to that solution in the future, but it must be moved out to as not to mislead the reader. Document type Good documentation should be written in one of four modes. It can be a tutorial, how-to guide, technical reference, or explanation. These modes were proposed by Diataxis framework, and we want to follow that method in the future. Generally: Tutorials are learning-oriented, and their purpose is to take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. It may be a getting started guide, end2end process, or preparing the working environment. How-to-guides should be written as a step list that is required to solve the problem . They are goal-oriented, which is the main difference between tutorials: how-to guides lead to solving some problems and are not focused on the learning experience. For example, building system images or modifying boot parameters. Reference guides are technical descriptions, and it is information-oriented. It is only information about some technical thing without an explanation of it in the larger context. A good example of that is a requirement list, description of functions or variables used in the program, or list of supported platforms. Explanation is a discussion focused on the understanding of some topic, like boot flow, description of specific communication protocol, or device provisioning. That document should explain the subject, not instruct how to do something. We should not create documents that are not related to these modes. Useful tools grammarly.com - online writing assistant who can improve your grammar and make the document clear. A premium account is a very useful option, but it is not a must. Core functionalities are available for free. It is highly recommended to use the Grammarly tool before committing changes. hemingwayapp.com - make your writing clear. Sometimes it catches things that are not detected by Grammarly. draw.io - we use that to prepare diagrams. paste.dasharo.com - pastebin alternative hosted by Dasharo. asciinema.org - free and open-source solution for recording terminal sessions. Sometimes - especially in more complex cases, it is good to present command sequences in this way. Formatting General rules of formatting documents: Use markdown preview to verify that document is rendering correctly. That feature is available in VS code, Github/Gitlab web IDE, and other tools. Line with code should not have more than 80 characters. To follow that rule, it is good to set the line at width 80 in your IDE. Here is how to do it in VS code. We also maintain the repository Dasharo/dev-tools-configs with editors configs used by our community. Feel free to create PR with your configuration - you can give your proposition to improve existing settings or create configs for editors that don't exist yet in our repository. A properly configurated editor simplifies correct formatting.","title":"Documentation guidelines"},{"location":"dev-proc/documentation-guidelines/#documentation-guidelines","text":"That document can be treated as an onboarding into creating and maintaining documentation in projects developed by Dasharo Team.

May not always be used, e.g. if edk2 is used as the primary framework. version means version according to official Dasharo Versioning documentation. For TianoCore UEFIPayloadPkg , we use the simpler and more recognizable UEFI name. Examples: Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) v1.0.0 - for coreboot-based builds with TianoCore UEFIPayload Dasharo (coreboot+SeaBIOS) v1.0.0 - for coreboot-based builds with SeaBIOS payload Dasharo (coreboot+Heads) v1.0.0 - for coreboot-based builds with Heads payload Dasharo (UEFI) v1.0.0 - for plain edk2-based builds System Information (Type 1) Devices with an existing BIOS implementation In this case, set all the fields that are relevant (excluding BIOS version and vendor) to the same values as the stock firmware. To obtain SMBIOS values from the stock firmware, either: Obtain the fwdump-docker logs from 3mdeb cloud Run dmidecode -t 1 on the machine itself Devices with no existing BIOS implementation In the case where the device does not have an existing supported BIOS or the client chooses to use different SMBIOS fields (e.g. to make it easier to differentiate devices), refer to the SMBIOS specification v3.5.0 .","title":"Dasharo Product Guidelines: SMBIOS Information"},{"location":"dev-proc/smbios-rules/#dasharo-product-guidelines-smbios-information","text":"","title":"Dasharo Product Guidelines: SMBIOS Information"},{"location":"dev-proc/smbios-rules/#introduction","text":"This document describes the guidelines for filling in the SMBIOS fields in devices supported by Dasharo.

Introduction During the 23+ years of coreboot's existence, one aspect that has never been in-depth tested is how its performance compares against proprietary firmware solutions that run on the same hardware platform. The lack of performance testing is because, for most of the interested parties, the selling point of coreboot was the transparency of being open-source, and this rarely made direct comparisons about other features or functionality. Historically, most of what we could find about coreboot performance involves the lower POST times claims, but there needs to be more information regarding its runtime performance as measured in benchmarks, which is a significant point that end users are interested in. Sadly, we need more internal resources and the necessary field experience to conduct such exhaustive benchmark testing. Several significant findings came from third-party benchmarks and community reports, which is enough to know our current standing. Professional hardware reviewers should be better at performing and analyzing measures than we are. Why We Ask To Fine Tune Settings In general, we found out in our limited benchmarking that performance out-of-the-box with Dasharo is measurably lower than performance with MSI proprietary firmware, in the order of 6-8% on the benchmarked Core i5 12600K. Lower performance was quickly tracked down to MSI using, by default, certain processor operating parameters that are quite different from the values stated on the Intel datasheets, resulting in alterations of the processor behavior that allows it to sustain Turbo Boost with higher clock speeds and for longer periods than otherwise possible, and thus appear to perform better overall. After normalizing across both MSI proprietary firmware and Dasharo, the values we found were different, and the benchmark difference was reduced to around 2% (21:19- 29:00) . We also found several review websites that have already written articles and analysis about this matter. Mainboard vendors use default values above those specified by Intel (technically overclocking) to produce better performance results in benchmarks ( AnandTech , TechSpot , VideoCardz , Gamers Nexus about cheating , GamersNexus about MSI default settings , GamersNexus Z490 YouTube Review , TechPowerUp , Tom's Hardware ). Depending on whom you ask, using aggressive values by default can be seen either as a convenience, since the end user gets more performance without having to know how to configure the firmware, or as a form of cheating, due to the end user usually having no idea about these changes and that they are overclocking out-of-the-box. As for the time being, we're sticking to Intel specification default values; these mainboard vendors' custom optimizations hurts us because it makes the difference look much bigger than it is. What we want to showcase is how Dasharo (for this MSI port, coreboot + EDKII UefiPayloadPkg) performance compares against the proprietary firmware codebase. The only way to do so accurately is by ensuring that the hardware operating values are the same in both Dasharo and the original firmware so that the performance differences are not due to higher processor clock speeds thanks to higher Power Limits, unlimited Turbo Boost times, or similar tricks. Note that we are okay with out-of-the-box comparisons, but that wouldn't be directly an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of both firmware codebases, which is our point. Thus, to make it fair, the hardware has to be tweaked to run with the same operating values on both. As you can't change values on Dasharo unless you're willing to recompile (or ask for a custom build with tweaked values), the easiest way is by bringing MSI firmware values down to Dasharo/Intel levels. Find Your Processor Intel Default Parameters So far we've found six processor-configurable parameters that differ significantly: PL1, PL2, PL1 Tau, ICCMAX, DC_LL, and AC_LL. coreboot uses the values found on two sections of the Intel 12th Generation Intel Core Processors Datasheet (Volume 1 of 2). You will have to check the datasheet to find the proper values for your processor so that you can manually input them onto MSI firmware. In the case of MSI firmware default values, we found no public information, so we only know how it autoconfigures the processors we tested. Note that on the datasheet, Intel doesn't mention processor models by name/number but instead classifies them by amount of P+E cores and Base Power TDP, so first, you have to check these two values from Intel Ark for your processor model, then check on the Datasheet tables what matches both classes to get the Intel default values for the configurable parameters. Here are examples covering the 12400, 12600K, 12900K and 12900KS ( Processor Line Thermal and Power - Package Turbo Specifications (S / HX - Processor Lines) - S-Processor Line LGA ) from this section of datasheet: 12400 6+0 Core 65W PL1 = 65W PL2 = 117W PL1 Tau = 28s 12600K 6+4 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 150W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900K 8+8 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900KS 8+8 Core 150W PL1 = 150W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s VCCCORE DC Specifications - Processor VCCCORE Active and Idle Mode DC Voltage and Current Specifications - Segment S-Processor Line from this section of datasheet: 12400 S-Processor Line (65W) 6+0 -Core ICCMAX = 151A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12600K S-Processor Line (125W) 6+4 -Core ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12900K S-Processor Line (125W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 12900KS S-Processor Line (150W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 1 On S-Processor Line, AC_LL is the same as DC_LL. For reference, on a 12600K, the MSI 1.70 firmware on Auto with CPU Cooler Tuning set to Boxed Cooler (lowest values for auto-configuration) uses the following values vs. Dasharo/Intel defaults: MSI BIOS 1.70 PL1 = 241W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 250A DC_LL/AC_LL = 80 Dasharo 1.1.0 PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 170 Configure MSI Firmware With Intel Default Parameters After you have found your processor model values, you can input them on MSI firmware. Most likely, you want to start from default settings. Enter MSI Firmware, and change the following: Settings Menu (Left Panel) -> Save & Exit Restore Defaults (Confirm Yes) Save Changes and Reboot (Confirm Yes) After the power off/on cycle, enter MSI firmware again, change the following values, then repeat Save Changes and Reboot: OC Menu (Left Panel) -> Advanced CPU Configuration Enhanced Turbo: Disabled (This is MSI name for Multi Core Enhancement) Long Duration Power Limit(W): PL1 Long Duration Maintained(s): PL1 Tau Short Duration Power Limit(W): PL2 CPU Current Limit (A): ICCMAX CPU Lite Load Control: Advanced (Required to input DC_LL and AC_LL as numbers instead of \"Modes\") CPU AC Loadline: AC_LL CPU DC Loadline: DC_LL Miscellaneous Comments Since you can software flash Dasharo and flash MSI firmware again on the same system, you likely want to use the same computer to test both firmware so that no temperature or clock speeds difference could attribute to different pressure on heatsink mounting or silicon lottery. MSI firmware bases its default (Auto) PL1, PL2, and ICCMAX values on the CPU Cooler Tuning set. When using Restore Defaults on a 12600K, this setting defaults to Water Cooler, which allows for technically unlimited PL1 and PL2 (4095W). Even the Boxed Cooler setting configures the 12600K to 241W PL1 and 241W PL2. Thus, you must manually set the individual values for controlled results. So far, the setting that most affected benchmark scores are AC_LL and DC_LL. PL1, PL2 and ICCMAX are limiting. They are only meaningful if the processor gets limited by them, which would depend on the processor model (some have more headroom than others. PL1 is 125W for both 6+4 12600K and 8+8 12900K, the latter would be severely more limited), whereas the other two values are always in effect. On the tested 12600K, the effect of the significantly lower values of AC_LL on DC_LL that MSI uses is a rather massive difference of 20 Watts in power consumption (as reported by ThrottleStop and HWiNFO, and also by lower processor temperatures) when running Cinebench R23. Thus, with MSI values (whenever on MSI or a custom Dasharo build with those), the 12600K doesn't even reach the PL1 limit, allowing it to maintain the highest Turbo Boost clock speeds infinitely, whereas, on Dasharo (or MSI with Intel default values), the extra power consumption makes it to go beyond PL1, eventually throttling back to slower clocks to keep under PL1. LCC (Loadline Calibration Control) is also present in another menu as CPU Loadline Calibration Control, but we left it at Auto. We need to find out if changes in CPU Lite Load Control / CPU AC Loadline / CPU DC Loadline change it or if LCC operates the same regardless of changes to the previous options. The most critical performance-related bug we found in Dasharo involves benchmarking Single Thread applications on Windows 11. With Dasharo, Windows 11 CPU Scheduler likes to move threads around between P and E cores, whereas MSI firmware on the same scenario instead always favors P cores. Such behavior significantly affects the scores of Single-Threaded benchmarks and makes them highly variable depending on which core type a thread spent most of its time. There may be MSRs (Model Specific Registers) related to Intel Thread Director that we aren't aware of that manages this. The only workaround found is to set CPU Affinity manually, which can be performed automatically with Process Lasso, with the bonus of using Forced Mode to continuously re-apply the CPU Affinity settings, as some applications, including Cinebench, like to change them when you start to run the benchmark. Of course, this will not happen on P core, only models like 12400. We did not test manual affinity tested on Linux. Dasharo currently doesn't support manually changing the memory clock speeds, and it will default to the highest standard JEDEC profile supported by the installed memory modules. MSI firmware also defaults to JEDEC profiles, so out-of-the-box, they're matched at memory configuration, thus not a problem. Many enthusiast-grade DDR4 modules use 3200 MHz (maximum supported by Alder Lake-S) or higher and have that clock speed as an XMP profile, whereas the standard JEDEC profile could be just 2133 or 2400 MHz. In most cases, a 3200 MHz DDR4 module will run at lower speeds than expected. There are modules rated for JEDEC 3200 MHz 22-22-22 @ 1.2V that should work in both Dasharo and MSI firmware, in case you're interested in testing this. It is also possible to force Dasharo to use an XMP profile if you're willing to recompile or use a custom build. There are a lot of other settings and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) that we have yet to test. We track the progress of that effort in this issue. Public Alder Lake FSP Integration Guide documents how to set these settings On or Off, but there are few details about how they change the Processor behavior. The remaining 2% of performance will come from matching all these settings. On the public datasheet, there is no DC_LL for the 8+8 150W class, only 8+8 125W, but we can confirm from alternate sources that this is the correct value. \u21a9","title":"Dasharo Reviewers Guide"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#dasharo-reviewers-guide","text":"Based on reviews of Dasharo compatible with MSI Z690-A DDR4/DDR5, we created the following guide to explain the performance gap between MSI proprietary and Dasharo open-source firmware, but in the long run, the same discoveries can apply to other Dasharo and open-source firmware solutions.","title":"Dasharo Reviewers Guide"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#introduction","text":"During the 23+ years of coreboot's existence, one aspect that has never been in-depth tested is how its performance compares against proprietary firmware solutions that run on the same hardware platform. The lack of performance testing is because, for most of the interested parties, the selling point of coreboot was the transparency of being open-source, and this rarely made direct comparisons about other features or functionality. Historically, most of what we could find about coreboot performance involves the lower POST times claims, but there needs to be more information regarding its runtime performance as measured in benchmarks, which is a significant point that end users are interested in. Sadly, we need more internal resources and the necessary field experience to conduct such exhaustive benchmark testing. Several significant findings came from third-party benchmarks and community reports, which is enough to know our current standing. Professional hardware reviewers should be better at performing and analyzing measures than we are.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#why-we-ask-to-fine-tune-settings","text":"In general, we found out in our limited benchmarking that performance out-of-the-box with Dasharo is measurably lower than performance with MSI proprietary firmware, in the order of 6-8% on the benchmarked Core i5 12600K. Lower performance was quickly tracked down to MSI using, by default, certain processor operating parameters that are quite different from the values stated on the Intel datasheets, resulting in alterations of the processor behavior that allows it to sustain Turbo Boost with higher clock speeds and for longer periods than otherwise possible, and thus appear to perform better overall. After normalizing across both MSI proprietary firmware and Dasharo, the values we found were different, and the benchmark difference was reduced to around 2% (21:19- 29:00) . We also found several review websites that have already written articles and analysis about this matter. Mainboard vendors use default values above those specified by Intel (technically overclocking) to produce better performance results in benchmarks ( AnandTech , TechSpot , VideoCardz , Gamers Nexus about cheating , GamersNexus about MSI default settings , GamersNexus Z490 YouTube Review , TechPowerUp , Tom's Hardware ). Depending on whom you ask, using aggressive values by default can be seen either as a convenience, since the end user gets more performance without having to know how to configure the firmware, or as a form of cheating, due to the end user usually having no idea about these changes and that they are overclocking out-of-the-box. As for the time being, we're sticking to Intel specification default values; these mainboard vendors' custom optimizations hurts us because it makes the difference look much bigger than it is. What we want to showcase is how Dasharo (for this MSI port, coreboot + EDKII UefiPayloadPkg) performance compares against the proprietary firmware codebase. The only way to do so accurately is by ensuring that the hardware operating values are the same in both Dasharo and the original firmware so that the performance differences are not due to higher processor clock speeds thanks to higher Power Limits, unlimited Turbo Boost times, or similar tricks. Note that we are okay with out-of-the-box comparisons, but that wouldn't be directly an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of both firmware codebases, which is our point. Thus, to make it fair, the hardware has to be tweaked to run with the same operating values on both. As you can't change values on Dasharo unless you're willing to recompile (or ask for a custom build with tweaked values), the easiest way is by bringing MSI firmware values down to Dasharo/Intel levels.","title":"Why We Ask To Fine Tune Settings"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#find-your-processor-intel-default-parameters","text":"So far we've found six processor-configurable parameters that differ significantly: PL1, PL2, PL1 Tau, ICCMAX, DC_LL, and AC_LL. coreboot uses the values found on two sections of the Intel 12th Generation Intel Core Processors Datasheet (Volume 1 of 2). You will have to check the datasheet to find the proper values for your processor so that you can manually input them onto MSI firmware. In the case of MSI firmware default values, we found no public information, so we only know how it autoconfigures the processors we tested. Note that on the datasheet, Intel doesn't mention processor models by name/number but instead classifies them by amount of P+E cores and Base Power TDP, so first, you have to check these two values from Intel Ark for your processor model, then check on the Datasheet tables what matches both classes to get the Intel default values for the configurable parameters. Here are examples covering the 12400, 12600K, 12900K and 12900KS ( Processor Line Thermal and Power - Package Turbo Specifications (S / HX - Processor Lines) - S-Processor Line LGA ) from this section of datasheet: 12400 6+0 Core 65W PL1 = 65W PL2 = 117W PL1 Tau = 28s 12600K 6+4 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 150W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900K 8+8 Core 125W PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s 12900KS 8+8 Core 150W PL1 = 150W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s VCCCORE DC Specifications - Processor VCCCORE Active and Idle Mode DC Voltage and Current Specifications - Segment S-Processor Line from this section of datasheet: 12400 S-Processor Line (65W) 6+0 -Core ICCMAX = 151A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12600K S-Processor Line (125W) 6+4 -Core ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.7 m\u03a9 (170) 12900K S-Processor Line (125W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 12900KS S-Processor Line (150W) 8+8 -Core ICCMAX = 280A DC_LL/AC_LL = 1.1 m\u03a9 (110) 1 On S-Processor Line, AC_LL is the same as DC_LL. For reference, on a 12600K, the MSI 1.70 firmware on Auto with CPU Cooler Tuning set to Boxed Cooler (lowest values for auto-configuration) uses the following values vs. Dasharo/Intel defaults: MSI BIOS 1.70 PL1 = 241W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 250A DC_LL/AC_LL = 80 Dasharo 1.1.0 PL1 = 125W PL2 = 241W PL1 Tau = 56s ICCMAX = 175A DC_LL/AC_LL = 170","title":"Find Your Processor Intel Default Parameters"},{"location":"guides/dasharo-reviewers-guide/#configure-msi-firmware-with-intel-default-parameters","text":"After you have found your processor model values, you can input them on MSI firmware.

MSI firmware bases its default (Auto) PL1, PL2, and ICCMAX values on the CPU Cooler Tuning set. When using Restore Defaults on a 12600K, this setting defaults to Water Cooler, which allows for technically unlimited PL1 and PL2 (4095W). Even the Boxed Cooler setting configures the 12600K to 241W PL1 and 241W PL2. Thus, you must manually set the individual values for controlled results. So far, the setting that most affected benchmark scores are AC_LL and DC_LL. PL1, PL2 and ICCMAX are limiting. They are only meaningful if the processor gets limited by them, which would depend on the processor model (some have more headroom than others. PL1 is 125W for both 6+4 12600K and 8+8 12900K, the latter would be severely more limited), whereas the other two values are always in effect. On the tested 12600K, the effect of the significantly lower values of AC_LL on DC_LL that MSI uses is a rather massive difference of 20 Watts in power consumption (as reported by ThrottleStop and HWiNFO, and also by lower processor temperatures) when running Cinebench R23. Thus, with MSI values (whenever on MSI or a custom Dasharo build with those), the 12600K doesn't even reach the PL1 limit, allowing it to maintain the highest Turbo Boost clock speeds infinitely, whereas, on Dasharo (or MSI with Intel default values), the extra power consumption makes it to go beyond PL1, eventually throttling back to slower clocks to keep under PL1. LCC (Loadline Calibration Control) is also present in another menu as CPU Loadline Calibration Control, but we left it at Auto. We need to find out if changes in CPU Lite Load Control / CPU AC Loadline / CPU DC Loadline change it or if LCC operates the same regardless of changes to the previous options. The most critical performance-related bug we found in Dasharo involves benchmarking Single Thread applications on Windows 11. With Dasharo, Windows 11 CPU Scheduler likes to move threads around between P and E cores, whereas MSI firmware on the same scenario instead always favors P cores. Such behavior significantly affects the scores of Single-Threaded benchmarks and makes them highly variable depending on which core type a thread spent most of its time. There may be MSRs (Model Specific Registers) related to Intel Thread Director that we aren't aware of that manages this. The only workaround found is to set CPU Affinity manually, which can be performed automatically with Process Lasso, with the bonus of using Forced Mode to continuously re-apply the CPU Affinity settings, as some applications, including Cinebench, like to change them when you start to run the benchmark. Of course, this will not happen on P core, only models like 12400. We did not test manual affinity tested on Linux. Dasharo currently doesn't support manually changing the memory clock speeds, and it will default to the highest standard JEDEC profile supported by the installed memory modules.

If you can't find the answer to your questions feel free to contact us through Community Channels or submit issue through Dasharo Github . Flashrom Following sections explain how to deal with most common flashrom problem. How to install flashrom ? Install flashrom v1.1 or newer with your distribution's package manager if you don't have it installed yet. If your distro doesn't provide flashrom or provides an outdated one, you can build it yourself using this instruction . Or compile recent version of flashrom: sudo apt install libpci-dev libftdi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev git clone https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom.git cd flashrom sudo make install Perform dry run to detect the problems early Most of the problems can be detected early and avoided without attempting to flash the firmware. You may check for most of the errors described here by doing a dry run (not passing any firmware binary): sudo flashrom -p internal In below sections there are example errors that you may find in the output of above command. Could not get I/O privileges (Operation not permitted) If you see a flashrom error like this: ERROR: Could not get I/O privileges (Operation not permitted). You need to be root. Error: Programmer initialization failed. It means you have insufficient privileges to perform initialization. Please use sudo before flashrom command. /dev/mem mmap failed: Operation not permitted /dev/mem mmap failed: Operation not permitted FAILED! FATAL ERROR! Error: Programmer initialization failed. Linux kernel restricts access to IOMEM. To fix that add iomem=relaxed to the kernel command line. Recommended way to fix the problem: Edit /etc/default/grub : GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX = \"iomem=relaxed\" Update GRUB2 config with: sudo update-grub2 Alternatively, if previous command doesn't work: sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg Reboot and try flashrom command again Other method: Edit grub.cfg in /boot/grub/ : linux /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-115-generic ro quiet iomem = relaxed Reboot and try flashrom command again Last resort you can try to modify boot option runtime. YMMV: If your computer uses BIOS for booting, then hold down the Shift , or if your computer uses UEFI for booting, press Esc several times, while GRUB is loading to get the boot menu. And, after getting a GRUB menu, press E on a boot entry to append iomem=relaxed to kernel command line and press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot. Although this setting is temporary and will last only during the next boot, this way is faster and a customer doesn't need to re-generate anything. Please note having it as a temporary setting maybe is slightly better for security (there's a reason why it's disabled by default) . If the above does not resolve the problem, the kernel may be compiled with strict devmem, which prohibits accessing the IOMEM. You should then take different Linux system.

Reproducible Builds and a lot of its aspects is well explained on the linked website. Why are reproducible builds crucial OSF? This is because knowing hashes of firmware components, we can calculate expected TPM PCRs values. By knowing good PCR values and being able to predict further values after firmware update, we are gaining the following advantages: We can easily confirm if the firmware is valid by reading TPM PCRs and compare to reference integrity measures (RIM), RIM can be calculated by build exactly the same version of OSF. NOTE : Please note that depending on your threat model using TPM chip with closed source firmware implementation may lead to solution which is not trustworthy. Process of replying measurements provided in TPM Event Log is simpler because we can easily obtain software and confirm hashes used during PCR extension the process was valid and the same as produced by the software build process Looking for bugs by using bisection is easier since being able to build every commit of software in a reproducible manner give us confidence that there would be no change in behavior between 2 consecutive builds Consistent behavior for given hash can be confirmed by test results tied to given hash in that way users looking at test results may expect exactly the same behavior for firmware binaries with the same hash Long term maintenance should be easier if firmware build would be reproducible over a long time, because often happen some firmware land in industrial applications, e.g., robots, trains, smart city infrastructure, if the bug will be detected after a long time; it is important to have tools and be able to confirm the same binary can be generated in the future. If we know given toolchain reproduce binary bit by bit we are sure it also reproduces software/firmware behavior. In that light making small incremental improvement using a toolchain that gives reproducible results give us higher the chance that we will not introduce uncontrolled change in behavior and code the change will be reflected by the compilation process without affecting previous software behavior. [OSFI0011] Docker containers as build systems \"considered harmful.\" Docker containers for a couple of last years become the default method for providing reproducible runtime environment for software as well those started to be very useful for developers to transfer exact configuration for building given software stack. We wrote about the usefulness of Docker containers in embedded software development environment on 3mdeb blog . After a long time of using Docker containers for embedded software development and build environments we noticed problems for long time maintenance and reproducibility. coreboot-sdk problems The example can be coreboot-sdk used for building coreboot project . A good summary of the problem was provided by Thrilleratplay in guix-docker repo : Currently, the coreboot build environment, coreboot-sdk , uses a Debian docker base image. To install additional required packages, apt-get update must be run. The resulting Docker image is hosted in the Docker hub repository to be retrieved at any time in the future. However, at any time in the future, building the same docker file will generate a different image based on the latest packages used in apt-get. Over time, as packages are updated due to bug, security or feature improvements, the docker image's provenance in the docker hub repository becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to audit and reproduce. Some more detailed notes related to coreboot-sdk issues are presented below. There is no meaningful versioning of SDK [1] - at some point, there was versioning 1.32-53, now switched to git SHA. Both seemed to have no meaning and were released at arbitrary points in time. The result is that it is hard to find which version of SDK works with the coreboot tree version. Validation of coreboot-sdk is not sufficient - for example, recently, python fixes were merged [2] , somehow this change passed all QA checks, but SeaBIOS use python (not python2 or python3) and all builds using this version of SDK that compile SeaBIOS fail. coreboot-sdk is based on moving target Debian sid. It is close to impossible to build the same Docker images at 2 different points in time. coreboot-sdk enforce given version of ACPI spec - this may not always be a good thing to use the most recent compiler and update code accordingly since it can easily break OSes. Why we care? Whenever we deliver code or service to community or customer, we provide build environment which, for the sake of quality user support, should be stable. CI pipelines rely on those containers. Replacing docker image in CI pipeline whenever something change defeat the purpose of having automation and increase maintenance cost significantly and increase maintenance cost significantly Requirements for OSF dev and build process Open-source firmware development and build environment SHOULD have: * meaningful release process * meaningful validation process, at least basic build system and dev env capabilities should be tested * meaningful revisions with a clear explanation of what software stack can be build with what version of dev and build system, a description should include side-spec compliance, e.g., ACPI, SMBIOS, UEFI, etc. * reproducible process that works across systems and in the long run * signature, so anyone can identify where build and dev env coming from and if it is trustworthy Ideas for solving the above issues Docker images are not reproducible - this is a known fact, and if we are extremely serious about stability, security and quality, we should stop using a not reproducible build environment. Of course, there is some work making Docker images reproducible, but it opens Pandora's box [3] of Yocto or Buildroot. Another path could be Nix or Guix, which is currently pursued in the community OSFW #guix-buildstack channel this is a private channel; feel free to ping anyone from 3mdeb Team to join. coreboot toolchain is built by its own build system, which would be hard to couple with Dockerfile or something else. Docker images can be signed using docker trust commands as described here . Other idea would be to use wget and dpkg -i for every needed package in Dockerfile that create base image for reproducible toolchain. Of course that means quite extensive dependency management, but maybe simplicity is worth the effort. It is also possible to maintain VMs per given coreboot (or other OSF) version. That may mean long term VM image compatibility issues as well as problems with making sure images would work with various hypervisor versions. It is even more complex if multiple OS should be supported. VMs also have quite big overhead in terms of performance I'm not tracking all activity in the community, so some claims may be plain wrong. Please let me know what I miss when I'm wrong.","title":"Firmware build process"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi001-build-process","text":"","title":"[OSFI001] Build process"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi0010-there-is-no-healthy-osf-without-reproducible-builds","text":"","title":"[OSFI0010] There is no healthy OSF without reproducible builds"},{"location":"osf-trolling-list/build_process/#osfi0011-docker-containers-as-build-systems-considered-harmful","text":"Docker containers for a couple of last years become the default method for providing reproducible runtime environment for software as well those started to be very useful for developers to transfer exact configuration for building given software stack.

We're excited to share our plans to integrate the TrenchBoot Project into Qubes OS's new Anti-Evil Maid (AEM) implementation. As you may know, traditional firmware security measures like UEFI Secure Boot and measured boot, even with a Static Root of Trust (SRT), may only sometimes be enough to ensure a completely secure environment for your operating system. Compromised firmware may allow for the injection of malicious software into your system, making it difficult to detect. To overcome these limitations, many silicon vendors have started implementing Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) technologies to establish a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. We're excited to take advantage of these advancements through integration with the TrenchBoot Project . The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs . In open-source projects, DRTM hasn't found its place yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot . TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS . Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks . However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). This effectively limits the usage of this security software to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default. Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following: Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the TPM firmware according to a newer specification. Qubes OS AEM has never supported any AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup technology. Implementing AMD support would make a huge impact and broaden the usage of DRTM technologies. The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot project , Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It had never any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform 3mdeb, with financial support from Qubes OS, developed a proof of concept replacing Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2. Qubes OS and 3mdeb already tested a new solution with Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid, which is available for community use. The result of this solution can be seen in the published blog post that concludes the first phase of integrating TrenchBoot Anti Evil Maid for Qubes OS. The numbering of the next phases of the project will commence with number 2 in order to maintain consistency with the work already completed in phase 1 . The following application describes the remaining work required to have production quality adoption in one of the most popular secure operating system on the market. What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve First of all Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to update the TrenchBoot components for AMD platforms to the recent boot protocol, which will allow AMD platforms to take advantage of the QubesOS AEM feature, and TrenchBoot. Requested support Phase 2 - TPM 2.0 support in Qubes OS AEM (Intel hardware): Implement support for TPM 2.0 module in Xen Required to measure Dom0 kernel and initial ram disk before they are executed. Implement support for TPM 2.0 event log in Xen Required to log the Dom0 kernel and initial ram disk hashes to the TPM event log. The event log could be used for future system attestation. Implement parallel CPU cores bring-up for DRTM launch Currently the CPU cores are being woken up in parallel, but later they are hacked to be waiting in a queue. If any interrupt would come at that time, it could be a serious danger. It has to be fixed as soon as possible, as required by Intel TXT specification. Integrate TPM 2.0 software stack into Qubes OS Dom0 Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform While AEM fully supports TPM 1.2 there is no support for TPM 2.0 at all. When the TPM family is determined the script should use the appropriate software stack for given TPM. The task implements the AEM TPM 1.2 equivalent functionalities using TPM 2.0 software stack and as a result allowing the use of TPM 2.0 with Qubes OS AEM. It will require implementing the access to TPM 2.0 NVRAM, sealing and unsealing the secret data and generating TOTP. Extend the AEM scripts to use appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0 Currently, only TPM 1.2 is supported in Qubes OS AEM service code. The 3 items above will ensure the necessary software for TPM 2.0 is available and AEM scripts executed early from the initrd can detect which TPM family is present on the platform and use appropriate software stack and functions. TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 software stacks are not compatible so the scripts themselves must use proper API for given TPM and its respective software stack. Update Qubes OS AEM documentation Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 and 2.0 using legacy boot mode Phase 3 - Update to the newest TrenchBoot boot protocol: Code rebase onto the most recent work implementing Secure Launch protocol being upstreamed to Linux and GRUB The current state of TrenchBoot support has diverged with what was developed for QubesOS AEM for Intel hardware with TPM 1.2. The task aims to update the work and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB and Linux kernel. Xen shall take similar approach as Linux kernel in terms of DRTM launch. Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 using legacy boot mode Phase 4 - AMD support for Qubes OS AEM with TrenchBoot: Update the Secure Kernel Loader (formerly LandingZone) package support for QubesOS Since the initial work done by 3mdeb engineers for AMD AEM in Qubes OS a lot of time has passed and Secure Kernel Loader - SKL (formerly Landing Zone) has improved a lot and added new features. SKL is an open-source module written by TrenchBoot developers required by AMD Secure Startup technology to perform DRTM launch. The task aims to refresh the previous work and update the SKL package for Qubes OS to the newest revision. TrenchBoot Secure Kernel Loader (SKL) improvements for AMD server CPUs with multiple nodes While SKL was extensively tested on System on Chip and single CPU platforms, it was not much tested on workstation/server segment CPUs which are more complex. For example one server CPU package may contain two independent CPUs inside called nodes. Each node will enable protection on the SKL during DRTM execution. This protection has to be disabled on each node when TrenchBoot DRTM tasks are done. The task implements the correct support for server CPUs in TrenchBoot SKL. Update TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD in GRUB2 Some work to implement TrenchBoot support for Qubes OS on AMD hardware has been done. GRUB2 with TrenchBoot support has been added to Qubes building system on 3mdeb fork . The task aims to update the work and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB2 and Linux kernel. Update TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD in Secure Kernel Loader The task aims to update the TrenchBoot boot protocol for AMD platforms in Secure Kernel Loader and align with the TrenchBoot boot protocol being upstreamed to GRUB2 and Linux kernel.

Please use the current version of the plan for up-to-date information Abstract The firmware is the heart of the security of a given system and should always be up-to-date to maintain the computer's security. However, being up to date does not prevent the firmware vulnerabilities from appearing. The Static Root of Trust (SRT) like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot and measured boot provided by the firmware is not always sufficient to establish a secure environment for an operating system. If the firmware is compromised, it could inject malicious software into operating system components and prevent the machine owner from detecting it. Silicon vendors implement alternative technologies to establish a Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) to provide a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. Either from SRT or DRT, these integrity measurements can be used for operating system attestation. However, DRT technologies are designed to provide the ability to establish a secure environment for integrity measurements at any arbitrary point of time instead of relying on the firmware, which requires machine reset to establish the aforementioned secure environment. The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs .

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform A similar approach was already tried by Assured Information Security (AIS) to boot Xen in UEFI mode with Intel TXT DRTM technology . However, this is only a tiny portion of the work covered by our proposal. Additionally, Qubes OS does not launch using Xen.efi like in the AIS work but uses Multiboot2 protocol with GRUB2 instead, making this approach unusable. Moreover, the Xen.efi approach is much more complex and assumes usage of Trusted Boot, limiting the feature to Intel hardware only. What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve First of all, Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM, which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to make Xen possible to boot in UEFI boot mode without Boot Services defined in UEFI specification. Boot Services are a set of functions exposed in UEFI structures that are used to help with handling the boot process. However, the main principle of DRTM technologies is to not depend on any external code that is not a part of the operating system software to be executed after DRTM. UEFI Boot Services are a part of the firmware of which DRTM tries to be independent. The whole security concept of DRTM depends on cutting the ties with firmware. Thus the work includes implementing the capability in Xen not to use the UEFI Boot Services, which GRUB2 would terminate before DRTM is executed. Xen also contains an option not to use the UEFI Runtime Services. Runtime Services is a set of functions available throughout the whole machine lifetime, which means some firmware functionalities are available even when the operating system is launched. Removing the Boot Services from Xen brings certain drawbacks to the system because the Boot Services hold essential information like memory map, TPM event log, graphics framebuffer, etc. This information must be extracted by GRUB before Boot Services are terminated and passed to the Xen. The proposed solution is to pass this information via the Multiboot2 tags defined in the specification for this particular Boot Services information. Another challenge would be to get the work merged in the upstream repositories. It would ensure the long-term support and maintenance of the solution and availability. Providing software packages to be used out of the box is crucial for technology availability. Requested support Phase 1: TrenchBoot Intel TXT and TPM 1.2 support Add TPM 1.2 support for Intel TXT in TrenchBoot GRUB2 The TrenchBoot support hasn't been implemented and verified with TPM 1.2 on Intel TXT path. This requirement ensures that the TPM 1.2 is also supported for older Intel hardware with Intel TXT. Xen Secure Launch - Intel TXT support in Xen for TrenchBoot Due to the requirements of Intel TXT and how it is utilized, it is impossible to use the Xen boot protocols defined in the UEFI or Multiboot2 specifications. This task aims to create a custom Intel TXT entry point for Xen, which would hand off to the standard Multiboot2 entry point and enable the direct launch of Xen by GRUB via DRTM on Intel hardware. Additionally, there is no support for launching Xen with Intel TXT other than Trusted Boot. It has to be ported from Trusted Boot specific code: constructing MLE header waking up APs restoring MTRRs reserving the TXT memory reenabling SMIs handling TXT shutdown and S3 resume/suspend TPM event log finding Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 1.2 with legacy boot mode Phase 2 - Qubes OS AEM TPM 2.0 support: Extend the AEM scripts to detect TPM version on the platform As TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 use different software stacks and tools, it is necessary to distinguish the TPM module family and use the appropriate software. The task will implement the logic to distinguish the TPM families. Extend the AEM scripts to use the appropriate software stack for TPM 2.0 While AEM fully supports TPM 1.2, there is no support for TPM 2.0 at all. When the TPM family is determined, the script should use the appropriate software stack for the given TPM. The task implements the AEM TPM 1.2 equivalent functionalities using TPM 2.0 software stack and as a result allowing the use of TPM 2.0 with Qubes OS AEM. It will require implementing the access to TPM 2.0 NVRAM, sealing and unsealing the secret data, and generating TOTP. Test the solution on Intel hardware with TPM 2.0 with legacy boot mode Phase 3 - Qubes OS AEM AMD support: Rebase and refresh TrenchBoot GRUB2 for QubesOS Some work to implement TrenchBoot support for Qubes OS on AMD hardware has been done. GRUB2 with TrenchBoot support has been added to Qubes building system on 3mdeb fork The task aims to refresh the work and align with the upstream Qubes OS GRUB2 repository Clean up the Secure Kernel Loader (formerly LandingZone) package support for QubesOS Since the initial work done by 3mdeb engineers for AMD AEM in Qubes OS, a lot of time has passed, and Secure Kernel Loader - SKL (formerly Landing Zone) has improved a lot and added new features. SKL is an open-source module written by TrenchBoot developers required by AMD Secure Startup technology to perform DRTM launch. The task aims to refresh the previous work and update the SKL package for Qubes OS to the newest revision. TrenchBoot Secure Kernel Loader (SKL) improvements for AMD server CPUs with multiple nodes While SKL was extensively tested on System on Chip and single CPU platforms, it was not tested on workstation/server segment CPUs which are more complex. For example, one server CPU package may contain two independent CPUs inside called nodes. Each node will enable protection on the SKL during DRTM execution, and this protection must be disabled on each node when TrenchBoot DRTM tasks are done. The task implements the correct support for server CPUs in TrenchBoot SKL. Test the solution on AMD hardware with TPM 2.0 and TPM 1.2 with legacy boot mode Phase 4 - Xen UEFI boot mode with DRTM: TrenchBoot support for UEFI boot mode for AMD in GRUB While TrenchBoot DRTM was extensively tested on Intel hardware with UEFI firmware and Linux, it was not on AMD platforms. This task ensures that DRTM works with UEFI boot mode on AMD processors in GRUB2 and Linux without UEFI Boot Services. TrenchBoot support for UEFI boot mode in Xen When UEFI boot mode with TrenchBoot is working with GRUB2 and Linux, all that is missing to fully support AMD and Intel hardware with Qubes OS AEM is the Xen support to boot in UEFI mode without Boot Services. This requires a significant amount of work to ensure that all information that Xen would obtain from UEFI Boot Services would still be available. The information has to be passed by GRUB2 to Xen via Multiboot2 protocol: EFI memory map Framebuffer information PCI devices information with their option ROMs Additionally \"EFI boot services not terminated\" Multiboot2 tag must not be passed to Xen by GRUB2 on DRTM launch when GRUB2 will terminate Boot Services. Xen should detect such situations and act according to the state of Boot Services. Xen will be implemented to: parse the EFI memory map, framebuffer information, and PCI devices information passed by GRUB2 do not expose the \"EFI boot services\" Multiboot2 tag indicating that Xen can be executed without UEFI Boot Services presence allocate the memory space for the trampoline used to launch other processors or use the allocation done by GRUB2 if necessary do not go error path when Boot Services are not present and skip all calls to UEFI Boot Services by using the information provided by GRUB2 Test the solution on AMD and Intel hardware with TPM 2.0 and TPM 1.2 with legacy and UEFI boot mode Projects or organizations relevant to this project before?

However, being up to date does not prevent the firmware vulnerabilities from appearing. The Static Root of Trust (SRT) like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot and measured boot provided by the firmware is not always sufficient to establish a secure environment for an operating system. If the firmware is compromised, it could inject malicious software into operating system components and prevent the machine owner from detecting it. Silicon vendors implement alternative technologies to establish a Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) to provide a secure environment for operating system launch and integrity measurements. Either from SRT or DRT, these integrity measurements can be used for operating system attestation. However, DRT technologies are designed to provide the ability to establish a secure environment for integrity measurements at any arbitrary point of time instead of relying on the firmware, which requires machine reset to establish the aforementioned secure environment. The usage of DRT technologies like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) or AMD Secure Startup becomes more and more significant, for example, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) requirements of Microsoft Secured Core PCs . DRTM hasn't found its place in open-source projects yet, but that gradually changes. The demand on having firmware independent Roots of Trust is increasing, and projects that satisfy this demand are growing, for instance, TrenchBoot . TrenchBoot is a framework that allows individuals and projects to build security engines to perform launch integrity actions for their systems. The framework builds upon Boot Integrity Technologies (BITs) that establish one or more Roots of Trust (RoT) from which a degree of confidence that integrity actions were not subverted. The project has grown a lot thanks to the previous NLnet NGI0 PET grant and now it looks for further expansion into extensive use of the DRT technologies in open-source and security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS . Qubes OS Anti Evil Maid (AEM) software heavily depends on the availability of the DRTM technologies to prevent the Evil Maid attacks . However, the project hasn't evolved much since the beginning of 2018 and froze on the support of TPM 1.2 with Intel TXT in legacy boot mode (BIOS). Because of that, the usage of this security software is effectively limited to older Intel machines only. TPM 1.2 implemented SHA1 hashing algorithm, which is nowadays considered weak in the era of forever-increasing computer performance and quantum computing. The solution to this problem comes with a newer TPM 2.0 with more agile cryptographic algorithms and SHA256 implementation by default. Qubes OS AEM software suffers from the following: Lack of TPM 2.0 support to handle more secure hashes and safer design of the TPM firmware according to a newer specification. Lack of UEFI mode support. All modern systems boot in UEFI mode only. Legacy boot modes are being deprecated and dropped from the PC firmware. The AEM usage is not possible on most if not all modern machines. Qubes OS AEM has never supported AMD processors with AMD Secure Startup technology. Implementing AMD support would make a significant impact and broaden the usage of DRTM technologies. The initial AEM implementation relied on the Trusted Boot , Intel's reference implementation of Intel TXT. It never had any plans to support AMD processors. TrenchBoot is filling this gap, supporting both Intel and AMD hardware which makes it an ideal target to replace Trusted Boot in Qubes OS AEM implementation. Furthermore, the project grant would be used to implement the missing pieces in the Qubes OS AEM software to cover the AMD and Intel support for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#compare-your-own-project-with-existing-or-historical-efforts","text":"3mdeb is a licensed provider for quality coreboot consulting services since 2016.

Among them, the Anti Evil Maid was frequently presented by 3mdeb engineers: Anti Evil Maid for Intel coreboot-based platform Anti Evil Maid for modern AMD UEFI-based platform A similar approach was already tried by Assured Information Security (AIS) to boot Xen in UEFI mode with Intel TXT DRTM technology . However, this is only a tiny portion of the work covered by our proposal. Additionally, Qubes OS does not launch using Xen.efi like in the AIS work but uses Multiboot2 protocol with GRUB2 instead, making this approach unusable. Moreover, the Xen.efi approach is much more complex and assumes usage of Trusted Boot, limiting the feature to Intel hardware only.","title":"Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#what-are-the-significant-technical-challenges-you-expect-to-solve","text":"First of all, Qubes OS AEM software consists of software packages providing Trusted Boot and the Qubes OS TPM scripts . These software packages would need to replace the Trusted Boot with TrenchBoot supported GRUB2 and Xen. Secondly, the TPM scripts require adding support for TPM 2.0 equivalent functionality. AEM requires access to non-volatile RAM inside TPM, which is defined differently in the TPM 2.0 specification compared to TPM 1.2. Another challenge would be to make Xen possible to boot in UEFI boot mode without Boot Services defined in UEFI specification. Boot Services are a set of functions exposed in UEFI structures that are used to help with handling the boot process. However, the main principle of DRTM technologies is to not depend on any external code that is not a part of the operating system software to be executed after DRTM. UEFI Boot Services are a part of the firmware of which DRTM tries to be independent. The whole security concept of DRTM depends on cutting the ties with firmware. Thus the work includes implementing the capability in Xen not to use the UEFI Boot Services, which GRUB2 would terminate before DRTM is executed. Xen also contains an option not to use the UEFI Runtime Services. Runtime Services is a set of functions available throughout the whole machine lifetime, which means some firmware functionalities are available even when the operating system is launched. Removing the Boot Services from Xen brings certain drawbacks to the system because the Boot Services hold essential information like memory map, TPM event log, graphics framebuffer, etc. This information must be extracted by GRUB before Boot Services are terminated and passed to the Xen. The proposed solution is to pass this information via the Multiboot2 tags defined in the specification for this particular Boot Services information. Another challenge would be to get the work merged in the upstream repositories. It would ensure the long-term support and maintenance of the solution and availability. Providing software packages to be used out of the box is crucial for technology availability.","title":"What are the significant technical challenges you expect to solve"},{"location":"projects/trenchboot-aem/#requested-support","text":"Phase 1: TrenchBoot Intel TXT and TPM 1.2 support Add TPM 1.2 support for Intel TXT in TrenchBoot GRUB2 The TrenchBoot support hasn't been implemented and verified with TPM 1.2 on Intel TXT path.

V1 cannot be greater than 3.3V (RTE property). Complete Setup After preparing all of the connections also three activities should be performed to enable all of the test stand features: Connect Sonoff to the mains: Connect the RTE to the Internet by using the Ethernet cable. Connect the RTE to the mains by using the microUSB 5 V/2 A power supply. Complete setup should looks as follows: Theory of operation The following sections describe how to use all of the enabled features: serial connection to the platform, controlling power supply, enabling basic power actions with the platform (power off/power on/reset), external flashing with the RTE, device power status readout. Serial connection The method of setting and using serial connection is described in the Serial connection guide . Power supply controlling Power supply controlling (in this case: controlling the state of Sonoff) should be performed based on the sonoff.sh script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). Note, that before using the above-mentioned script, it should be modified and SONOFF_IP parameter should be set in accordance with obtained Sonoff IP address. To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the power supply: ./sonoff on Turn off the power supply: ./sonoff on Basic power operations Basic power operations should be performed based on the rte_ctrl script implemented in meta-rte (OS image dedicated to the RTE platform). To perform basic power operations use the below-described commands: Turn on the platform: rte_ctrl pon Turn off the platform: rte_ctrl poff Reset the platform: rte_ctrl reset Note, that in order for the above commands to work properly, the platform should be powered up: both Sonoff and the power supply must be turned on. External flashing The external flashing procedure should be performed based on the scripts implemented on the RTE platform. To perform the flashing operation reproduce, the below-described steps: By using scp put the requested Dasharo file to the RTE: scp <path_to_firmware>/<firmware_file> root@<RTE_IP>:/tmp/coreboot.rom Where: path_to_firmware - path to firmware, which should send to RTE, firmware_file - the name of the firmware file, which should be sent to RTE, RTE_IP - IP address of the connected RTE. Login to RTE via ssh or minicom . Read the flash chip by executing the following command on RTE: ./flash.sh read tmp/dump.rom If the reading was successful, the output from the command above should contain the phrase Verifying flash...

Try not to tighten all the elements to the maximum, as it will make disassembly difficult. Remember that make all connections in the grounding strap. Device assembly Full set assembly Section below describes the procedure of complete assembling of the working station. Unpack all equipment. Place the motherboard in front of you, this is the component with which most of the operations will be performed. It's best to put something softer under the board so as not to damage it, e.g. during the installation of RAM modules. To install the CPU on the motherboard first, open the CPU socket: Insert the processor carefully and tighten it with the dedicated mechanism: To install the CPU cooler, the parts shown in the picture below are necessary: Attach the black stand to the bottom of the motherboard, then apply and screw down the remaining parts except the cooler itself and apply thermal paste. After these steps, the CPU area should look like this: Then attach the cooler from above by tightening the two screws. Most likely, for this operation, it is necessary to dismantle the fan and restore it after tightening the screws. Install the memory module into the DIMM slots. To insert a single module, open the latch on both sides. Then insert the RAM and gently press the module downward at both ends of the module and the latch will close automatically. Always insert memory modules in the DIMMA2 slot first. Install the M.2 solid-state drive (SSD) into the M.2 slot. Remove the two screws from the cover and the one responsible for disk stabilization. Insert the SSD into the M.2 slot and tighten the previously removed screws. Take the enclosure of the computer and open one side as shown in the picture below: Install the rear panel by inserting it from the inside of the enclosure and pressing it lightly. Insert the motherboard into the case but do not twist it, some pins are hard to connect when the motherboard is screwed. The photo below shows the slots that should be filled in the next steps. Connect the fan from the CPU cooler to the slot marked I . Connect the cables from the front panel to the appropriately marked places: A detailed description of the connection cable marked D can be found in the Board manual in section: JFP1, JFP2: Front Panel Connectors. To verify correct connection of the cable marked D , you can compare them to the pictures below: Connection from the inside: Connection from the outside: Connect the speaker to the slot marked before E : Screw the motherboard to the enclosure. Connect the power supply to the motherboard using the cables marked RE25 for connection to the G and H slots and the cable marked RJ21 to connect the F slots. Connect the fan built into the enclosure to the indicated place: Bundle the cables so that they don't interfere with the fans or other components. Close the case of the computer. Motherboard assembly only Section below describes the procedure of assembling the motherboard. To prepare the motherboard the following operations should be performed: Go through steps 1-8 from Full set assembling section . Go through 13th step from Full set assembling section . Connect cable marked D to allows power on the device as described in the 14th point of the Full set assembling section . Connect the power supply to the motherboard as described in the 17th point of the Full set assembling section . Device validation Connect the device to the mains. Power on the device with the button located on the front panel. If all connections have been made correctly, the device should start and the boot logo should be shown. Install Dasharo firmware in accordance with Initial Deployment - the Migrating SMBIOS unique data chapter can be skipped. Power on the device. Boot to Linux system (Ubuntu is recommended). Open a terminal window and run the following command: sudo dmidecode -t 0 | grep Version The output of the command above should be similar to: Version: Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) <version> where the version should correspond to the version of the flashing binary used eg. v1.0.0.

Cortex-M0 flashing The second controllable unit on the muxPi board is embedded microcontroller STM32 F030C6T6 from Cortex-M0 family. It is required to flash special binary prepared by Tizen group (the code is not open yet, but this process is in progress). To flash muxPi's microcontroller, follow steps below: Make sure that VDD jumper is left open. Download binary file - link . Copy binary to nanoPi: scp <path-to-file> root@192.168.4.XXX:/root/ Update package lists (nanoPi): apt-get update Install stm32flash utility (nanoPi): sudo apt-get install stm32flash Export GPIO: gpio mode 3 out and gpio mode 7 out Set Cortex-M0 to \"Flashing mode\": gpio write 7 1 Power up microcontroller: gpio write 3 1 Flash firmware: stm32flash -w /root/firmware-05.bin -v -g 0x0 /dev/ttyS2 Power off microcontroller: gpio write 3 0 Set Cortex-M0 to \"Execution mode\": gpio write 7 0 Power on microcontroller: gpio write 3 1 From now on, muxPi's LCD should light on and display: * MuxPi * HW: 1 .0 SW: 0 .5 3. SD Adapter Connect IDC-uSD adapter to the muxPI board: Insert the microSD card to microSD card slot accessible on the bottom side of muxPi board. To enable microSD card reader, connect to Cortex from MuxPi via minicom: minicom -D /dev/ttyS2 and enter in minicom following commands: ts and then dut NOTE: Each command should return OK Connect IDC-uSD adapter to a SD card adapter plugged into your machine NOTE: You need to force IDC-uSD adapter to insert into SD card adapter (On your machine) Check if device is connected: dmesg -w should help.

Download and extract image - link Flash image into microSD card ( Etcher tool could be helpful) Insert card to NanoPi microSD slot. Attach NanoPi to muxPi connectors. Plug Ethernet cable to RJ45 NanoPi port. Serial communication There are two methods to setup serial communication with muxPi: with microUSB<->USB cable with UART/USB converter Attach USB/UART converter to muxPi's left addon female header ( GND , DBG UART RX , DBG UART TX on pinout image below): and plug USB connector to the computer. Next, open connection in PC terminal by typing: sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o -b 115200 . /dev/ttyUSB0 is example device - check whether USB0 is the correct one Jumpers configuration UART - pins Vloc & VCC - if jumped then internal voltage generator is used as voltage reference for data lines and powers up target device. If open then voltage reference for data lines comes from target device and internal voltage generator is unused. USB/ETH - determines what USB data lines of one USB HUB are connected to. If first two pins are jumped then USB lines are connected to add-on connector. If last two pins are jumped then these lines are connected tu USB<->ETH converter. If none of the pins are jumped then the only connection is the upper socket of double connector. NOTE: The upper socket of double USB-A connector must be left empty if USB<->ETH is selected or add-on connector is selected and something is connected to these data lines on the addon! NOTE: Both jumpers must be placed in the same position! VDD - if this pins are jumped then the VDD and 3V3 are always on. If this is left open then VDD and 3V3 are controlled by NanoPi. The usage example is setting value of USB ID potentiometer (which is located underneath NanoPi). But when NanoPi NEO is removed there is no way to turn on power for microcontroller (that is when VDD jumper is helpful). NOTE: If there is no particular need then leave this jumper open. Power supply To power on MuxPi with NanoPi attached, plug the 5V/2A DC 5.5/2.1mm power supply jack to the CON1 muxPi's connector. Power consumption of MuxPi should be less then 1A assuming no addons connected. IP address To check which IP address has been assigned, type in terminal: ifconfig . OPTIONAL STEP: To set static IP, create the following file: sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf Edit NetworkManger.conf and set the value of \"managed\" under \"ifupdown\" to false: [ ifupdown ] managed = false Add network setting to /etc/network/interfaces : sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces Here is sample of /etc/network/interfaces : # The loopback network interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback # network interface not managed by Network Manager allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192 .168.4.XXX netmask 255 .255.255.0 gateway 192 .168.4.1 dns-nameservers 192 .168.4.1 Restart the whole device: reboot Now you should be able to connect to device through ssh: ssh root@192.168.4.XXX with the password: fa Install WiringNP Connect to NanoPi NEO through ssh (serial connection automatically login to non root user pi ), then type: git clone https://github.com/friendlyarm/WiringNP cd WiringNP/ chmod 755 build ./build Verify installation: gpio readall If your installation is successful the following messages will show up: +-----+-----+----------+------+---+-NanoPi-NEO--+------+----------+-----+-----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Physical | V | Mode | Name | wPi | BCM | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----++----+---+------+----------+-----+-----+ | | | 3 .3V | | | 1 || 2 | | | 5V | | | | 12 | 8 | GPIOA12 | ALT5 | 0 | 3 || 4 | | | 5V | | | | 11 | 9 | GPIOA11 | ALT5 | 0 | 5 || 6 | | | 0v | | | | 203 | 7 | GPIOG11 | OFF | 0 | 7 || 8 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOG6 | 15 | 198 | | | | 0v | | | 9 || 10 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOG7 | 16 | 199 | | 0 | 0 | GPIOA0 | ALT5 | 0 | 11 || 12 | 0 | OUT | GPIOA6 | 1 | 6 | | 2 | 2 | GPIOA2 | OFF | 0 | 13 || 14 | | | 0v | | | | 3 | 3 | GPIOA3 | OFF | 0 | 15 || 16 | 0 | OFF | GPIOG8 | 4 | 200 | | | | 3 .3v | | | 17 || 18 | 0 | OFF | GPIOG9 | 5 | 201 | | 64 | 12 | GPIOC0 | ALT4 | 0 | 19 || 20 | | | 0v | | | | 65 | 13 | GPIOC1 | ALT4 | 0 | 21 || 22 | 0 | ALT5 | GPIOA1 | 6 | 1 | | 66 | 14 | GPIOC2 | ALT4 | 0 | 23 || 24 | 1 | OUT | GPIOC3 | 10 | 67 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----++----+---+------+----------+-----+-----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Physical | V | Mode | Name | wPi | BCM | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+-NanoPi-NEO--+------+----------+-----+-----+ +-----+----NanoPi-NEO USB/Audio-+----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Ph | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ | | | 5V | | | 25 | | | | USB-DP1 | | | 26 | | | | USB-DM1 | | | 27 | | | | USB-DP2 | | | 28 | | | | USB-DM2 | | | 29 | | | | IR-RX | | | 30 | | 17 | 19 | GPIOA17 | OFF | 0 | 31 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 32 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 33 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 34 | | | | PCM/I2C | | | 35 | | | | 0V | | | 36 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ +-----+----NanoPi-NEO Debug UART-+----+ | BCM | wPi | Name | Mode | V | Ph | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ | 4 | 17 | GPIOA4 | ALT5 | 0 | 37 | | 5 | 18 | GPIOA5 | ALT5 | 0 | 38 | +-----+-----+----------+------+---+----+ Cortex-M0 flashing The second controllable unit on the muxPi board is embedded microcontroller STM32 F030C6T6 from Cortex-M0 family.

It is connected to unswitchable power line. The current sensor is bypassed with 3 0R resistors that can be populated if current sensor is not needed. These resistors must not be populated if current measurement is required. UART connections GND - digital ground of MuxPi board N.C. - not connected Vloc - local voltage - voltage may be generated internally on MuxPi if the DUT, or anything else we are connecting to, has not power pin. Nn such case voltage generator must be set to desired value and activated. Command \"uart 3300\" must be sent to Cortex-M0, where 3300 is desired voltage given in millivolts. The voltage range is from 0 to 5000mv. Pins Vloc an VCC must be connected each other. Typical jumper is a perfect connector for this purpose. Vloc may be also used to power up additional converter RS232C. For example if converter to RS232C (+/-12v) must be used then it may be powered from Vloc pin. VCC - power of DUT. If dut has no such power pin then it must be connected to Vloc and vloc must be configured properly as stated above. DUT RX - receiver data line in the DUT - through this line MuxPi sends data to the DUT DUT TX - transmitter data line in the DUT - from this line MuxPi reads data form the DUT DUT CTS - Clear To Send - hardware handshake DUT RTS - Ready To Send - hardware handshake Example configuration for OrangePi (DUT) uart connection: Set 3.3V Vloc (/dev/ttyS2 terminal): uart 3300 Attach UART jumper ( Vloc and Vcc ). Connect GND, RX and TX (without crossing). Open connection: screen /dev/ttyS1 115200,cs8,ixon,ixoff NOTE: RX , TX , XTS , RTS are crossed on the board so you don't need to cross the wires by yourself. NOTE: A device powered from Vloc mustn't draw more than 50mA of current. Add-ons Add-ons headers are extensions for attaching new shields or simply using NanoPi and CortexM0 interfaces: 5V - power supply - not switchable - always present 3V3 - switchable (controlled by NanoPi) 3.3V power supply I2C0 SDA - I2C0 SDA line connected to NanoPi I2C0 SCL - I2C0 SCL line connected to NanoPi DBG UART TX - UART0 (debug) of NanoPi DBG UART RX - UART0 (debug) of NanoPi USB B+/- , USB A+/- USB host lines connected to NanoPi through USB HUB GND - ground lines N.C . - not connected SPI0 CLK - SPI0 clock line connected to NanoPi SPI0 MOSI - SPI0 \"master output slave input\" line connected to NanoPi SPI0 CS - SPI0 \"chip select\" line connected to NanoPi SPI0 MISO - SPI0 \"master input slave output\" line connected to NanoPi PI GPIO 1,2,3 - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) connected to NanoPi NEO. Ports PG11, PL11, PA17 respectively. ST GPIO 1,2,3 - GPIO connected to Cortex-M0 microcontroller. Ports PB3, PB4, PB5 of STM32F03C6T6 respectively. ADC1,2 - analog inputs connected to analog to digital converter of Cortex-M0 microcontroller. Ports PA1, PA2 respectively. Voltage range of this input is 0 to 3.3V. This lines are not buffered in any way so attention must paid when dealing with them. GND - ground lines NOTE: PI GPIO 1 has additional special function. It is connected to Cortex-M0 Boot0 pin which enables firmware download mode during microcontroller boot. 1 - enables this mode while 0 disables it. So it is useless as GPIO when the microcontroller is being booted. DyPers Dyper is a small, electromagnetic relay which is controllable by software. There are 2 dypers on MuxPi board. Each of them has two channels. Both channels are switched at the same time with the same command. So both of them can be on and both can be off but there is no way to turn one on and one off. They can be controlled by CortexM0 - examples here . ETH and USB ETH and upper USB of double USB socket share the same USB channel from USB HUB. Jumpers located at the rear side of double USB connector allow to disconnect this USB from ETH and connect to add-on connector. Details on this topic are covered in jumpers section. USB-M This is USB connector dedicated to mobile devices from Samsung company. This connector has controllable Vbus line and also controllable ID line. More information about this type of interface, it's capabilities and example of flashing smartphone can be found here . SD Adapter This connector is used to connect microSD card, put into MuxPi, to a DUT. This connector requires IDC-uSD cable adapter: Target microSD card must be attached to microSD card reader accessible on bottom side of muxPi board. To enable microSD card reader, connect to Cortex from MuxPi via minicom: minicom -D /dev/ttyS2 and enter in minicom following commands: ts and then: dut Each command should return OK After doing this you can connect the uSD's end of the cable adapter to the external card reader and check if it is correctly recognized by PC. You should also be able to run the microcontroller from the card attached to MuxPi if the card contains appropriate OS. Interacting with muxPi Connection with NanoPi User can simply open SSH connection by (password: fa ): ssh root@<muxpi-ip-address> or use serial connection mentioned here NOTE: Connecting with MuxPi through serial will automatically login as non root user pi with password pi .

Prerequisites Prepared RTE Two jumpers Choose one of the following cables depending on the connectivity to your platform: RS232<->RJ45 cable, RS232<->RS232 cable, USB<->RS232 cable, micro-USB<->USB cable, 3-wire cable. Setting serial connection Put the two jumpers on RTE J16 Header : For the RS232 port, they join COM and RS232 rows both on RX and TX columns. For the UART port (only during using a 3-wire cable), they join COM and EXT rows both on RX and TX columns. For the micro-USB-USB cable, jumpers aren't required. Connect the RTE header (J14 or J18) with the device serial port. Use the cable according to the DUT specification: DUT has a serial port -> needs to use an RS232<->RS232 cable. DUT has the debug port in the form of the RJ45 -> needs to use an RS232<->RJ45 cable. DUT has the debug port in the form of the USB -> needs to use an RS232<->USB cable. DUT has the debug port in the form of the micro-USB -> needs to use a micro-USB<->USB cable. DUT doesn't have a port but has pins for serial connection on the board -> need to use a 3-wire cable. Connect with RTE via ssh or minicom . To connect via ssh is required to know RTE IP and connection to the internet on both sides. While using a minicom there is a need to use the USB-UART converter. There are two ways to open a serial connection: Telnet - by executing the following command: telnet 192 .168.X.X 13541 To configure telnet connections, update the file /etc/ser2net.conf using vim . Then reboot the RTE to apply the changes. The dmesg command allows to identify the latest connected devices.

Linux This section covers Linux post-install steps tested on Ubuntu 22.04. It is likely thas similar procedures would for others Linux distributions as well. Touchpad hotkey enablement The touchpad hotkey needs extra setup to function correctly under Linux. To enable the touchpad hotkey to work under Linux, follow the steps below: Execute fixup script: curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dasharo/dasharo-tools/main/clevo/touchpad-fixup | sudo sh After executing these steps, it should be possible to enable and disable the touchpad using the touchpad hotkey (Fn+F1) on the keyboard when using GNOME. Touchpad multi-touch support On NS7x an additional fix is necessary to enable multi-touch on Linux.

This version contains additional fixes for newer hardware which helps with power management and suspend on Gen 12 laptops. To install the ubuntu-oem kernel, run the following command: sudo apt install linux-oem-22.04a and reboot to use the new kernel. Nvidia drivers It is only necessary to follow this step if your device has Nvidia GPU For proper working of the sleep mode on Ubuntu 22.04, it is required to install additional Nvidia drivers. Install drivers by executing the following command in the terminal: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-515 nvidia-dkms-515 Reboot the device to apply changes by executing the following command in the terminal: sudo reboot (Optional) For power saving while the card is not in use, enable On-Demand mode in NVIDIA Control Panel: Suspend fix for SATA disks Only affects laptops with M.2 SATA disks experiencing sleep issues (the power LED not blinking while the laptop is suspended) Windows and certain Linux distros such as Ubuntu do not enable the necessary power saving tweaks to enable sleep mode while a SATA disk is installed.

It assumes some knowledge about external flashing and is primarily aimed at technicians performing initial installation and not for end users of the devices. Installing Dasharo Initial Installation 12th Gen (Alder Lake) 11th Gen (Tiger Lake) During the initial installation of Dasharo, you should deploy the supported Intel ME version (and configuration) on the device. Since vendor firmware has enabled Intel Boot Guard and BIOS Guard, it is not possible to do this from within the operating system and external flashing of the whole flash chip using a programmer like the CH341a is required. Publicly released binaries do not contain ME binary. If you need an Intel ME update for your device, contact us via already established commercial support channel. Preparation Install flashrom: apt update apt upgrade sudo apt -y install flashrom BIOS installation Steps for installing Dasharo BIOS: Remove the bottom cover of the laptop. NS5x / NS7x NV4x Disconnect the primary battery. (1) Disconnect the CMOS battery. (2) Attach a WSON-8 probe to the SPI flash chip. (3) For TGL devices use SOIC clip instead of WSON Backup the current firmware, in case you want to be able to restore it at some point: flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r bios_backup.rom Install Dasharo BIOS, replacing [path] with the path to the firmware image you want to flash, e.g. novacustom_ns5x_adl_full_v1.4.0.rom flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w [ path ] Detach the WSON-8 probe. Connect the primary battery and reconnect the CMOS battery Power on the laptop. The laptop may shut down once after training the memory. EC firmware installation Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for flashing ITE embedded controllers such as the ones present in NovaCustom laptops. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from source. Run the following commands on the target laptop: Install build dependencies: apt update apt upgrade apt install git build-essential debhelper pkg-config libpci-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev meson Obtain source code: git clone https://github.com/dasharo/flashrom.git cd flashrom Build flashrom: make sudo make install Make a backup of the EC firmware: Remember to store the backup on the separate device in case flashing fails. flashrom -p ite_ec -r ec_backup.rom Install the EC firmware: Warning: After running this command, the internal keyboard and power button will stop responding until the device is power cycled (all power must be removed, including the internal battery). Be prepared to disconnect the battery after updating the EC. Alternatively, you can boot up the laptop without the battery connected and power it from an AC adapter. Then, once the EC update is complete, disconnect the AC adapter to power off the laptop. Run the following command, replacing [path] with the path to the EC firmware you want to flash, e.g. novacustom_ns5x_adl_ec_v1.4.0.rom flashrom -p ite_ec -w [ path ] Successful installation of Dasharo EC finishes the initial deployment process. Automatic deployment For 11th Gen Intel Core based models, Dasharo Tools Suite zero-touch initial deployment is available.

Note the results. Expected result Silent fan profile Keep in mind that the EC firmware is smoothing, i.e. the fans will enter the target speed with a delay. The algorithm by which the EC calculates the speed is as follows: If the temperature is below the first one defined in the curve, set the speed to 0. If the temperature is above the last defined curve, set the maximum speed. If the temperature is equal to one of the temperatures of the points on the curve, set the speed from that point on the curve If the temperature is between points on the curve: slope = ( right_point_speed - left_point_speed ) /right_point_temperature - left_point_temperature ) speed = slope* ( temperature - left_point_temperature ) + left_point_speed Divide the PWM value by 2.55 to get the percentage to compare. Example check for 30\u00b0C and 70 PWM values: ```text expected_speed = ((30-25)/(65-0))*(30-0)+25 \u2248 27 actual_speed = 70/2.55 \u2248 27 ``` Values expected_speed and actual_speed are strongly similar.

Switch active PCR banks depending on the currently active banks.: if both SHA1 and SHA256 are active, deactivate SHA1 if SHA1 only is active, activate SHA256 and deactivate SHA1 if SHA256 only is active, activate SHA1 and deactivate SHA256 Press F10 to save and go back to the main setup page using ESC key. Use the Reset option on the main setup page to reboot the DUT. After reset a prompt should appear explaining a TPM state change request has been made. Press F12 as instructed to apply changes. The DUT will need to reboot again. After the reboot enter the Device Manager -> TCG2 Configuration again. Scroll down to the bottom of the page using arrow down key. Verify the active PCR banks were changed according to the choice made in step 5. NOTE: Certain TPMs like Intel PTT (fTPM) do not allow to set more than one active PCR bank at a given time, that is why the test case keeps only one bank active. Discrete TPMs may have multiple banks enabled simultaneously, but it is TPM module and TPM firmware dependent. Expected result The prompt appears at step 8. The requested changes are applied as verified in step 11. The prompt seen on the DUT screen has the following format (example change from SHA256 to SHA1): A configuration change was requested to PCR bank(s) of this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module) WARNING: Changing the PCR bank(s) of the boot measurements may prevent the Operating System from properly processing the measurements.

Alternative automatic fan control If you are using a coreboot for KGPE-D16 built from 4.11 branch or earlier there is also a software option to enable automatic fan control without modifications in coreboot. In order to configure the fan control, one needs to install the following package: apt-get install fancontrol Now we need to configure the fancontrol application by generating a /etc/fancontrol file containing the relation of temperature inputs to fans. Be sure that w83795 module is loaded (you may also add the module to be loaded automatically with echo w38795 >> /etc/modules ). Execute: pwmconfig This application will lead you through the process of identifying the relation of the fans and temperatures. Simply follow the instructions printed on the console. At the end do not select save and ext, just configure all PWMs, e.g.: Select fan output to configure, or other action: 1 ) hwmon0/device/pwm1 3 ) Just quit 5 ) Show configuration 2 ) Change INTERVAL 4 ) Save and quit select ( 1 -n ) : 1 Then set up temperature correlation by selecting either k10temp or hwmon0/device/temp7_input as temperature source for the fan1 (they should report identical temperature).

To read from the flash and save it to a file ( backup.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r backup.rom Flashing Dasharo To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command - replace [path] with the path to the Dasharo image you want to flash, e.g. asus_kgpe-d16_v0.3.0_2M_vboot_TPM1.2.rom . flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). The platform should power on normally now. You can connect the battery back if it was disconnected.","title":"Initial deployment"},{"location":"variants/asus_kgpe_d16/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment","text":"Initial deployment of Dasharo firmware on ASUS KGPE-D16 can be done: using DTS v1.1.0, manually.","title":"Initial deployment"},{"location":"variants/asus_kgpe_d16/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment-using-dts","text":"Initial deployment for ASUS KGPE-D16 is supported in DTS since version v1.1.0.

Simply connect the power supply to ATX compatible connectors on the mainboard (SSIPWR1, SSI12V1, SSI12V2). SPI BIOS SPI flash is a socketed DIP-8. There is no simple way to attach to it with any tools. That is why we have thought about the qspimux made by Felix Held which can attach to various SPI modules footprints and sockets. The DIP-8 adapter is put into the DIP-8 socket on the mainboard, which allows attaching the qspimux SPI multiplexer. The multiplexer is responsible for switching between the external SPI lines and the mainboard lines routed to the external SPI flash chip. The external flash chip is soldered on a SOIC8 adapter, which is connected to the qspimux. The connection of the RTE and qspimux is as follows: RTE header J7 pin qspimux J101 pin 1 (VCC) 2 (VCC_PROG) 2 (GND) 7 (GND) 3 (CS) 1 (CS_PROG#) 4 (SCLK) 6 (CLK_PROG) 5 (MISO) 8 (IO0_DI_PROG) 6 (MOSI) 3 (IO1_DO_PROG) 7 (NC) Not connected 8 (NC) Not connected Additionally, one has to tie the IO3_HOLD_PROG (qspimux pin 4) high, so connect it to the 3.3V permanently. Another additional GPIO is required to control the routing of SPI lines. The MUX_SEL (qspimux pin 9) decides whether the programmer is allowed to access the SPI flash or the mainboard. One more GPIO is used to control state of #WP of the flash chip by connecting GPIO to IO2_WP_PROG. The proposed connections used: RTE GPIO400 to control MUX_SEL RTE GPIO401 to control IO3_HOLD_PROG RTE GPIO402 to control IO2_WP_PROG Simple flashing script looks as follows: # select flash <-> programmer echo \"0\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio400/value # deassert SPI HOLD# echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio401/value flashrom -w firmware.bin -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 # select flash <-> board echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio400/value Controlling state of #WP: # configure direction of the pin echo \"out\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/direction # deassert WP pin to disable hardware protection of status registers echo \"1\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/value # assert WP pin to enable hardware protection of status registers echo \"0\" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio402/value RTE header J10 pin qspimux J101 pin 1 (GPIO400) 9 (MUX_SEL) 2 (GPIO401) 4 (IO3_HOLD_PROG) 3 (GPIO402) 5 (IO2_WP_PROG) qspimux schematic is available here Serial Asus KGPE-D16 has a DB9 serial connector for the debug UART. Connect it to the RTE via RS232 DB9 cable. TPM Asus KGPE-D16 has an LPC header for TPM or debugging. Since there is no other option to connect a TPM, we use the header for that purpose. IMPORTANT: Use only TPM modules which match their pinout with the board's header! Using a spider web connection degrades the signal quality to the point where CPU cannot properly talk to TPM via LPC bus. Tested with PC Engines TPM module and failed to succeed this way. Designing and producing proper TPM header and/or reliable adapter, could solve this problem. The TwPM project could help here in the future. TPM modules that were tested and verified to work in 3mdeb lab with coreboot: ASUS TPM-L R2.0 module (chip Infineon SLB9665 TT 2.0) ASUS TPM 1.2 Rev 1.02h module (chip Infineon SLB9635 TT 1.2) Power management Asus KGPE-D16 provides a front panel pin header (PANEL1): RTE header J11 pin Asus KGPE-D16 8 (OC buffer output) PANEL1 pin 11 (PWR) 9 (OC buffer output) PANEL1 pin 17 (RESET) Additionally, connect one of the PANEL1 ground pins to one of the ground pins on RTE. Manunal For more details about the KGPE-D16, refer to the manual . Theory of operation Flashing There are two RTEs connected to two Asus KGPE-D16 boards: 192.168.20.15 192.168.4.111 Both boards are equipped with the qspimux and a replaced flash chip (Winbond W25Q64FV 8MB). The flash chip is attached to the qspimux with an adapter available with qspimux. Flashing may be done via the commands shown earlier or the flash script which is present in the root directory of the RTE: ./flash.sh coreboot.rom The script will automatically power off the board and update flash chip contents using flashrom. After the operation is finished the routing of SPI signals is restored to the platform. The flash chip adapter In order to provide an easy way to protect the SPI flash chip one may use a DIP-8 to SOIC-8 adapter with a special long pin header for WP pin jumper. It allows to use a SOIC-8 packaged flash in the DIP-8 socket and easily place a jumper to protect the flash. In order to assembly the adapter you will need the target SPI flash chip (we use either Winbond W25Q64FV (8MB) or W25Q128JV (16MB)), male pin headers 2.54 mm pitch (6 pins) male long pin headers 2.54 mm pitch (2 pins) for the WP jumper SOIC-8 to DIP-8 adapter soldering station and the solder The build shall look like this: Such adapters are now available in our online shop for purchase. For more details how to enable SPI flash protection refer to SPI Flash protection page . Power management RTE can control the power of the board with the RteCtrl command-line application, or with the web GUI ( RteCtrl ) available at RTE's IP address port 8000. Possible commands are: ./RteCtrl -pon # power on the platform ./RteCtrl -poff # force 5seconds power button power off ./RteCtrl -reset # briefly assert platform reset pin to perform reset It is also possible to control the ATX power supply by disconnecting it from the power socket. For this special purpose, Sonoff S20 is used to remotely control the power socket activity. Sonoff IP to RTE IP mapping: RTE IP 192.168.20.15 - Sonoff IP 192.168.4.125 RTE IP 192.168.4.111 - Sonoff IP 192.168.4.146 Sonoffs respond to rest API requests to enable or disable the power socket. Shell scripts have been added to RTE root directories to ease the control of power of the KGPE-D16 platform: #!/bin/bash SONOFF_IP = 192 .168.4.125 if [[ \" $1 \" == \"off\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay/turn_off --method = POST elif [[ \" $1 \" == \"on\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay/turn_on --method = POST elif [[ \" $1 \" == \"show\" ]] ; then wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay echo -e '\\n' else echo -e \"\\$1 == on|off|show|toggle\\nEdit this script to set the sonoff ip.\" echo -e 'Current state:' wget -q -O - http:// $SONOFF_IP /switch/sonoff_s20_relay echo -e '\\n' fi To turn off the power from the platform ./sonoff.sh off and to turn it on ./sonoff.sh on . Invoking the script without any argument will print the current state of the switch. Serial console access A serial port is very useful in debugging and as a remote console of the system on the platform. The serial port of KGPE-D16 is connected to the RTE's serial port which can be accessed on RTE with /dev/ttyS1 . One may use minicom directly or take advantage of the ser2net service running on RTE which exposes the serial port over the network. The serial port can be accessed remotely like this telnet RTE_IP 13541 , e.g.: telnet 192 .168.20.15 13541 Demo A short demo presenting RTE capabilities with KGPE-D16: Remote access If you are interested in developing coreboot on KGPE-D16 and have some spare time, there is a possibility to obtain access to the hardware.

Take your coreboot.rom file and use cbfstool to show its contents: cd /path/to/coreboot/build ./cbfstool coreboot.rom print FMAP REGION: COREBOOT Name Offset Type Size Comp cbfs master header 0x0 cbfs header 32 none fallback/romstage 0x80 stage 171040 none fallback/ramstage 0x29d40 stage 98703 LZMA ( 229532 decompressed ) config 0x41f40 raw 709 none revision 0x42240 raw 723 none build_info 0x42540 raw 101 none fallback/dsdt.aml 0x42600 raw 7055 none cmos.default 0x441c0 cmos_default 256 none cmos_layout.bin 0x44300 cmos_layout 3676 none fallback/postcar 0x451c0 stage 21216 none img/nvramcui 0x4a500 simple elf 70630 none fallback/payload 0x5b940 simple elf 69936 none payload_config 0x6cac0 raw 1621 none payload_revision 0x6d140 raw 237 none pci8086,10d3.rom 0x6d280 raw 82944 none etc/sercon-port 0x816c0 raw 8 none ( empty ) 0x81700 null 8128932 none bootblock 0xffcac0 bootblock 13056 none The bootblock is taking slightly more than 12KB of space on the bottom of the flash. Converting 12KB to hex would be equal to 0x3000 but we must cover a little bit more than that. Let's see what protection ranges are available for the chip (running from the tagret machine to be protected): ./flashrom -p internal --wp-list ... Available write protection ranges: start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00000000 ( none ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00001000 ( lower 1 /2048 ) start = 0x007ff000 length = 0x00001000 ( upper 1 /2048 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00002000 ( lower 1 /1024 ) start = 0x007fe000 length = 0x00002000 ( upper 1 /1024 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00004000 ( lower 1 /512 ) start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00008000 ( lower 1 /256 ) start = 0x007f8000 length = 0x00008000 ( upper 1 /256 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00020000 ( lower 1 /64 ) start = 0x007e0000 length = 0x00020000 ( upper 1 /64 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00040000 ( lower 1 /32 ) start = 0x007c0000 length = 0x00040000 ( upper 1 /32 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00080000 ( lower 1 /16 ) start = 0x00780000 length = 0x00080000 ( upper 1 /16 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00100000 ( lower 1 /8 ) start = 0x00700000 length = 0x00100000 ( upper 1 /8 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00200000 ( lower 1 /4 ) start = 0x00600000 length = 0x00200000 ( upper 1 /4 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00400000 ( lower 1 /2 ) start = 0x00400000 length = 0x00400000 ( upper 1 /2 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00600000 ( lower 3 /4 ) start = 0x00200000 length = 0x00600000 ( upper 3 /4 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00700000 ( lower 7 /8 ) start = 0x00100000 length = 0x00700000 ( upper 7 /8 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00780000 ( lower 15 /16 ) start = 0x00080000 length = 0x00780000 ( upper 15 /16 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007c0000 ( lower 31 /32 ) start = 0x00040000 length = 0x007c0000 ( upper 31 /32 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007e0000 ( lower 63 /64 ) start = 0x00020000 length = 0x007e0000 ( upper 63 /64 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007f8000 ( lower 255 /256 ) start = 0x00008000 length = 0x007f8000 ( upper 255 /256 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007fc000 ( lower 511 /512 ) start = 0x00004000 length = 0x007fc000 ( upper 511 /512 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007fe000 ( lower 1023 /1024 ) start = 0x00002000 length = 0x007fe000 ( upper 1023 /1024 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x007ff000 ( lower 2047 /2048 ) start = 0x00001000 length = 0x007ff000 ( upper 2047 /2048 ) start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00800000 ( all ) The output abvoe comes from Winbond W25Q64FV, a 8MB chip. Bootblock is always mapped to the bottom of the flash. 1MB is equal to 0x100000 so 8MB would be 0x800000. We need at least 0x4000 (16KB) to be protected starting at the bottom of the flash. And fortunately we have found our best match: start=0x007fc000 length=0x00004000 (upper 1/512) . Clearing SPI write protection Now that we have selected the desired range to protect, it is time to check the current protection status: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-status ... WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 0 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 0 BP0 = 0 Protection range: start = 0x00000000 length = 0x00000000 ( none ) Protection mode: disabled The protection range should be set to zeros and all WP config bits should be cleared. If you see some bits were not cleared, ensure the WP pin jumper on the flash is not placed and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0 ,0 now that we have a clear state of the flash protection we may proceed with enabling the right range. Setting protection range Copy the range base and length and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x007fc000,0x00004000 Setting SPI status register protection Flashrom should report Sucessfully set the requested protection range. . Now set the status register protection so the range protection cannot be changed: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-enable Flashrom should report Sucessfully set the requested mode. . Verifying SPI write protection To check whether the settings are desired invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-status ... WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 1 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Protection range: start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) Protection mode: hardware If it matches what you have wanted to set it is time to lock the status register protection bit (SRP0) from being changed. SRP0 protects the CMP, SEC, TB and BPx bits from being changed. In order to lock the SRP0 bit you have to place the jumper on the WP pin and tie it to ground (GND). This will assert the WP pin and prevent any WP config bits from being changed. To verify it invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable ... Writing new WP configuration failed during verification: Expected configuration: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Actual configuration: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 1 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 You should get the above result. Changing the protection range Now if you want to reprogram the protection range, you need to take off the jumper and invoke: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-disable Now you should get Sucessfully set the requested mode. now. Check the WP status: WP config bits: SRP1 = 0 SRP0 = 0 CMP = 0 SEC = 1 TB = 0 BP2 = 0 BP1 = 1 BP0 = 1 Protection range: start = 0x007fc000 length = 0x00004000 ( upper 1 /512 ) Protection mode: disabled It must indicate Protection mode: disabled . Now you may reconfigure the range, e.g. ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x007e0000,0x00020000 And proceed with enabling protection and setting back the jumper. Setting flash protection for vboot In case when vboot is enabled the protection range must be extended in order to cover other parts of the firmware. Vboot model assumes there is a read-only copy of the coreboot and payload called recovery partition. The recovery partition is supposed to be protected with a SPI write protection. The read-only region contains the bootblock, verstage (vboot stage used to verify other firmware components) and vboot keys and all other stages required to boot the platform in case of emergency. Typically the read-only partition occupies a space that matches the possible write protected regions of the flash chip. There are also read-write partitions (up to 2) that contain an updatable copies of the coreboot and payload. Unlike read-only partitions, read-write partitions are being verified using the signatures put into the read-write partitions. vboot checks the signature and decides whether read-write partition is safe to boot, otherwise it proceeds with execution of recovery firmware. The boot flow is shown on the diagram below: In order to properly protect the firmware, one has to lock whole WP_RO region define by flashmap in coreboot. To locate the region offset and size one has to use cbfstool to retrieve layout: cd /path/to/coreboot/build ./cbfstool coreboot.rom layout -w This image contains the following sections that can be accessed with this tool: 'RW_MISC' ( read-only, size 524288 , offset 0 ) 'UNIFIED_MRC_CACHE' ( read-only, size 131072 , offset 0 ) 'RECOVERY_MRC_CACHE' ( size 65536 , offset 0 ) 'RW_MRC_CACHE' ( size 65536 , offset 65536 ) 'SMMSTORE' ( preserve, size 262144 , offset 131072 ) 'CONSOLE' ( size 131072 , offset 393216 ) 'RW_NVRAM' ( size 16384 , offset 524288 ) 'RW_SECTION_A' ( read-only, size 5750784 , offset 540672 ) 'VBLOCK_A' ( size 8192 , offset 540672 ) 'FW_MAIN_A' ( CBFS, size 5742528 , offset 548864 ) 'RW_FWID_A' ( size 64 , offset 6291392 ) 'WP_RO' ( read-only, size 2097152 , offset 6291456 ) 'RO_VPD' ( preserve, size 16384 , offset 6291456 ) 'RO_SECTION' ( read-only, size 2080768 , offset 6307840 ) 'FMAP' ( read-only, size 2048 , offset 6307840 ) 'RO_FRID' ( size 64 , offset 6309888 ) 'RO_FRID_PAD' ( size 1984 , offset 6309952 ) 'GBB' ( size 16384 , offset 6311936 ) 'COREBOOT' ( CBFS, size 2060288 , offset 6328320 ) It is at least possible to perform the read action on every section listed above. The above example shows the KGPE-D16 8MB target with vboot enabled. The WP_RO section is at offset of 6291456 bytes from the beginning of the flash and has size of 2097152 bytes. These numbers are in decimal, so one must convert them to hex. Either use an online hex converter or use the command in bash like a pro :) printf \"0x%x\\n\" 6291456 0x600000 printf \"0x%x\\n\" 2097152 0x200000 So our WP range would be 2MB at 6MB offset start=0x00600000 length=0x00200000 (upper 1/4) . But before proceeding with setting the WP range, one may want to sign the firmware with own vboot keys. The Dasharo build come by default with Google vboot developer keys, so to take advantage of vboot, one should sign the binary before flashing and setting the WP range. Refer to vboot signing . Unfortunately the utilities support only 2 RW partitions for resiging. Otherwise a whole image must be rebuilt. After custo mkeys have been used to sign the ifmrware image and the image has been flashed proceed with enalbing the protection: ./flashrom -p internal --wp-range = 0x00600000,0x00200000 Then proceed with Setting SPI status register protection and Verifying SPI write protection . At this point you should have your coreboot firmware with vboot well protected and ready to go. Place the jumper in order to prevent any changes to the configuration.","title":"SPI write protection"},{"location":"variants/asus_kgpe_d16/spi-wp/#spi-hardware-write-protection","text":"In order to from a Root of Trust in the firmware, e.g. in the immutable piece of firmware code for Static Root of Trust of Measurement one has to ensure the protection of this piece of code.

KGPE-D16 16MB flash with ASUS TPM 1.2 Rev 1.02h (Infineon SLB9635 TT1.2). Both chips are supported by coreboot. For the time being the platforms will be tested with ASUS modules until OSHW lpnTPM with open-source TPM firmware is ready. Measured boot behaviour It is also possible to have builds without vboot: TPM 1.2 measured boot only (no vboot) for 2MB, 8MB and 16MB flash TPM 2.0 measured boot only (no vboot) for 2MB, 8MB and 16MB flash These targets are for cases where only the bootblock is intended to be locked to form Static Root of Trust for Measurement. For details how to lock flash depending on the firmware variant (with or without vboot) refer to SPI hardware write protection . Note the targets without vboot do not need to have any division into read-only and read-write partitions. Everything can be contained in a single COREBOOT flashmap region like in a standard coreboot build to have the largest free space for big payloads like heads. The variants without vboot have enabled measured boot with an additional option to initialize the TPM in bootblock in order to send the measurements directly to TPM in bootblock and other early stages.

From that point you can use firmware update methods to update your firmware. Troubleshooting If you do not see the logo after a few seconds, something probably went wrong, or you encountered a bug. If the LED on the power button shines white, that means the platform booted correctly. If the power button LED constantly shines in orange color, that means you have hit an error. The LED will start blinking soon. If you see the logo and after that system does not starts (black screen), please take the following steps: Put a bootable USB stick to the USB port.

Please read this extensive analysis contributed to Intel Reddit. Why do you use the nomenclature MSI Z690-A (WIFI) (DDR4) ? This nomenclature is the result of the naming used by the producer. MSI PRO Z690-A is the nomenclature used for naming the platform with DDR5 memory slots. If the platform is also equipped with the WiFi module, its naming nomenclature will additionally include the phrase WIFI . If instead of DDR5 memory slots, the platform is equipped with DDR4 memory slots, its naming nomenclature will additionally include the phrase DDR4 . Will this work on my MSI PRO Z690-A (model with DDR5 support)? Yes, during test procedures the Dasharo firmware work has been confirmed for the DDR5 platform without WIFI. Dasharo working correctness has not been tested on MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI . However, given its similarity to the other boards, there should be no problems using Dasharo on it as well. Will this work on my MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 ? Yes, during test procedures the Dasharo firmware work has been confirmed for the DDR4 WIFI platform. In turn, Dasharo working correctness on MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 has been confirmed by the community. Can I safely try this on my board? If you are afraid of bricking the board and have no means of recovering from failed installation , we do not recommend trying it out until at least the v1.0.0 is released. Recovery process is not suitable for inexperienced users right now. We will be trying to make it easier, and if that happens, we may change our recommendation here. Can I destroy my hardware by installing this firmware? We give no warranty, although it is highly unlikely, provided that you use the supported board model and follow the Initial Deployment . In the worst scenario, you might \"brick\" the board, rendering it unbootable. It can be fixed by following the recovery procedure . In case of concerns, we invite you to buy the equipment directly in our online store with a subscription service, under which we perform the Dasharo installation with the latest release, and offer full support through invite-only Matrix channel. How can I know if the board is \"bricked\"? In such a case, you would get stuck with black screen on the display. There will be no beeping sounds from the buzzer as well. The only way to get some information on what's going on in that state is to use the Serial header to read out error information. What can be the reason of board \"bricking\"? The most common reason would be the fact that you DDR memory modules are not initialized properly. The other reason might be improper or interrupted installation. Please make sure to follow the Initial Deployment Manual correctly. How can I \"unbrick\" my board? Please follow the recovery procedure . Which CPUs are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported CPUs is available in the CPU HCL documentation. In practice, any Alder Lake-S Processor should work. 12900KS is rather unknown at the moment, because it was released later and may require more recent microcode. Which memory modules are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported memory modules is available in the Memory HCL documentation. What is the memory profile? Currently, Dasharo firmware picks the highest standard SPD Profile, no support for XMP ones. This means that on the Kingston modules it is actually working at 2400 MHz, but it is expected to work all the way to 3200 MHz. Why my GPU doesn't work on MSI PRO Z690-A (DDR4) (WIFI) ? Due to the fact, that there's no possibility to insert all available GPU drivers into the firmware, the solution in the form of the Option ROM is in use. Option ROMs are the drivers flashed in the GPUs non-volatile memory. These types of drivers can be divided into Legacy Option ROMs and EFI Option ROMs . Legacy Option ROMs are only supported on legacy BIOS, such as SeaBIOS. Legacy BIOS checks the availability of Option ROM and if its signature matches, it executes its entry point. This option ROM initializes the graphics. The only way to support Option ROM in UEFI is through CSM, which we do not have implemented. EFI Option ROMs are nothing more than EFI drivers which have the same form as the UEFI files (PE format). UEFI firmware scans the Option ROM space of the graphics card and if it finds a potential EFI Option ROM with PE signature, it executes the file. This option ROM initializes the graphics. Considering the above, the firmware might have a problem with initializing older graphics cards - UEFI standard appeared about 15 years ago. The problem might also be caused by an enabled Secure boot - because there is no certainty that EFI Option ROM is signed correctly. Which GPUs are supported? We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community. The list of all supported memory modules is available in the GPU HCL documentation. What does the obligatory Dasharo Subscripion includes? The Dasharo Bronze Subscription includes: The latest Dasharo release installed by Dasharo Team Dasharo Updates \u2013 number of updates depends on the number of Dasharo Subscriptions sold and the availability of other funding (e.g., NLNet, corporate sponsors, community donations ) Priority support for Dasharo Subscribers through invite-only Matrix channel Influence on Dasharo features roadmap \u2013 you can have a real impact on Dasharo development by direct access with the developers or premium voting on github. You will gain the access to the dedicated channels on the matrix communicator. If you wish to share your Github nickname with us, the votes cast for the features that you would like to have implemented in the future will be treated with priority, i.e. they will have a higher priority than the votes of non-subscribers. By buying this product, you support open-source firmware and Dasharo distribution. What means in warranty conditions \"No signs of customer interference...\"? Full question: \"In the Disclaimer, you wrote that one of the warranty conditions is: \"No signs of customer interference with the platform or firmware.\" How would a user modify firmware without losing the warranty?

Option ROMs are the drivers flashed in the GPUs non-volatile memory. These types of drivers can be divided into Legacy Option ROMs and EFI Option ROMs . Legacy Option ROMs are only supported on legacy BIOS, such as SeaBIOS. Legacy BIOS checks the availability of Option ROM and if its signature matches, it executes its entry point. This option ROM initializes the graphics. The only way to support Option ROM in UEFI is through CSM, which we do not have implemented. EFI Option ROMs are nothing more than EFI drivers which have the same form as the UEFI files (PE format). UEFI firmware scans the Option ROM space of the graphics card and if it finds a potential EFI Option ROM with PE signature, it executes the file. This option ROM initializes the graphics. Considering the above, the firmware might have a problem with initializing older graphics cards - UEFI standard appeared about 15 years ago. The problem might also be caused by an enabled Secure boot - because there is no certainty that EFI Option ROM is signed correctly.","title":"Why my GPU doesn't work on MSI PRO Z690-A (DDR4) (WIFI)?"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/faq/#which-gpus-are-supported","text":"We can say the \"supported\" one is the one that have been tested during Validation Procedure or have been tested by the community.

The update process may be different, depending on which firmware version is currently installed on your device. The currently installed firmware version can be checked with the following command in a Linux environment: sudo dmidecode -t bios | grep Version Alternatively, it can be checked in the BIOS Setup Menu . Prerequisites Before proceeding, ensure that the firmware protections are disabled in Dasharo Security Options . Both BIOS boot medium lock and Enable SMM BIOS write protection should be unchecked. UEFI Secure Boot must be disabled as well (uncheck Attempt Secure Boot if Current Secure Boot State does not say Disabled ). To apply changes you will need to reboot. Please use one of the following environments to perform Dasharo update: Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) Linux distribution of your choice We recommend using the DTS. Dasharo Tools Suite DTS is already equipped with a correct flashrom build. Get Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS) ISO and burn it on a USB stick. Since DTS v1.1.2 you may simply choose the firmware update option from the menu as described in DTS Firmware Update section and DTS will carry out all necessary operations (RECOMMENDED). If you would like to do it manually you will need to download a firmware update binary. When you boot DTS from USB enter the shell from the menu and invoke following commands for v1.1.1 for example (you can find the links in the Releases section ): wget https://3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/Dasharo/msi_ms7d25/v1.1.1/msi_ms7d25_v1.1.1_ddr4.rom Or for DDR5 platform: wget https://3mdeb.com/open-source-firmware/Dasharo/msi_ms7d25/v1.1.1/msi_ms7d25_v1.1.1_ddr5.rom They will also work in any Linux terminal with wget installed. Then proceed with commands described in subsequent sections after. Linux distribution of your choice Linux distributions may not yet have the support for the newest chipsets in flashrom installed via package manager so building the flashrom from source may be inevitable. You may check if your flashrom supports the Z690 chipset by doing a dry run without firmware binary: sudo flashrom -p internal Example output of undetected chipset: flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.19.0-32-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). Cannot open file stream for /dev/mtd0 No DMI table found. WARNING: No chipset found. Flash detection will most likely fail. ======================================================================== You may be running flashrom on an unknown laptop. We could not detect this for sure because your vendor has not set up the SMBIOS tables correctly. Some internal buses have been disabled for safety reasons. You can enforce using all buses by adding -p internal:laptop=this_is_not_a_laptop to the command line, but please read the following warning if you are not sure. Laptops, notebooks and netbooks are difficult to support and we recommend to use the vendor flashing utility. The embedded controller (EC) in these machines often interacts badly with flashing. See the manpage and https://flashrom.org/Laptops for details. If flash is shared with the EC, erase is guaranteed to brick your laptop and write may brick your laptop. Read and probe may irritate your EC and cause fan failure, backlight failure and sudden poweroff. You have been warned. ======================================================================== No EEPROM/flash device found. Note: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't found automatically. It means you cannot proceed with this flashrom version and you have to remove it using your package manager. Then follow the procedure for building the right flashrom is described in Build flashrom section in the Initial deployment documentation (note the procedure describes Ubuntu case only, your package manager and package names to install may be slightly different). We recommend to use Dasharo Tools Suite . Example of good output: flashrom v1.2-1031-g6b2061b on Linux 5.19.0-32-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). No DMI table found. Found chipset \"Intel Z690\". Enabling flash write... SPI Configuration is locked down. FREG0: Flash Descriptor region (0x00000000-0x00000fff) is read-write.

Initial deployment using DTS Initial deployment for MSI PRO Z690-A (WIFI) (DDR4) is supported in DTS since version v1.1.0. Please check Dasharo zero-touch initial deployment section . Please do not use DTS to deploy Dasharo on MSI PRO Z690-A (WIFI) DDR5; otherwise, you will brick your hardware. There are at least two bugs that have to be fixed before it is possible: Power off problem Unsupported mainboard flashing problem . Initial deployment manually Flashing coreboot can be done from Linux using flashrom with the internal programmer. This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 22.04. Build flashrom Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for Alder Lake S internal flashing. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from 3mdeb fork . The procedure is based on Ubuntu 22.04 desktop amd64 ISO burned on the USB stick. Ubuntu 22.04 or newer if preferred, as it contains the network drivers for Ethernet and WiFi. Older versions of Ubuntu would require a USB to Ethernet adapter or equivalent to get a network connection and install required software packages. Boot the Ubuntu live image and select the Try Ubuntu option. Open a terminal and proceed with the commands below. Install build dependencies: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install git build-essential pkg-config libpci-dev udev Obtain source code: git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/flashrom.git -b dasharo-release cd flashrom Build and install flashrom: sudo make install Flashing All flash operations require UEFI Secure Boot to be disabled. You may download the binary using scp (need to install openssh-server package) or wget command. The binaries can be found on the release page . Reading flash contents Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read the original firmware from the flash and save it to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: sudo flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom IMPORTANT! You will need a second USB storage to keep the dumped firmware backup or alternatively upload it to some cloud or network drive (Ubuntu live has a Firefox browser installed). Ubuntu live image is volatile and has no persistent storage. All changes made in the live image will be lost after reboot. Migrating SMBIOS unique data To migrate the SMBIOS system UUID and board serial number follow the Linux instructions below before attempting to flash the binary. The procedure is supported on Dasharo version v1.0.0 and later and requires cbfstool built from coreboot tree.

Please check Vboot documentation how to resign the data. It is the machine owner's responsibility to generate and use own keys during updates. Flashing Dasharo WARNING : If you use an external/discrete GPU and migrate to Dasharo, be sure to unplug the dGPU first (when the machine is powered off before proceeding with flashing), as Dasharo firmware does not support all GPU cards properly yet (as of version v1.0.0). There is a high risk for the graphical output to break in the firmware when dGPU is connected. Effectively it leaves the only option to boot in blind into a previously installed OS (if the platform does not brick and if an OS is present on a disk). The first boot may take up to 2 minutes to fully train the memory, so be patient and wait for the Dasharo logo to appear, subsequent boots will take only seconds. MSI EZ debug leds are not supported by Dasharo and you may notice a red led to be lit. If the platform boots with an integrated GPU, you may try to plug the external GPU back and boot again. To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command: Replace the VERSION in firmware file name with the version you want to flash. For example: msi_ms7d25_v1.1.0_ddr4.rom . sudo flashrom -p internal -w msi_ms7d25_vVERSION { _ddr4,_ddr5 } .rom --ifd -i bios IMPORTANT! After the command succeeds, invoke sudo reboot or click the reboot/restart in the GUI to reboot the board. Press ENTER when prompted on the screen to remove the installation media (if Ubuntu live is used). DO NOT POWEROFF THE BOARD as SMI handlers of original MSI firmware may overwrite flash contents and cause a brick. After migration from MSI firmware to Dasharo and reboot, the firmware will fail the memory training. After reboot wait approximately 30 seconds and then power the board off by holding the power button pushed for 5 seconds. Dasharo v1.1.0 or newer will signal the memory training failure with PC speaker beeps and blinking SATA LED. When it happens use the power button to power the board off (no need to wait 30 seconds in such case). Power on the board back. Now the memory training should not fail and after approximately 1 minute (can be nearly 2 minutes for DDR5 memory), you should get a Dasharo splash screen on the monitor. Subsequent boots will take only a few seconds. Flashing back vendor firmware sudo flashrom -p internal -w dump.rom --ifd -i bios NOTE: Dasharo version v0.1.0 will not have a network connection. Use a different USB storage or a USB to Ethernet/USB WiFi adapter to move the binary to the live system.","title":"Initial deployment"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment","text":"Initial deployment of Dasharo firmware on MSI PRO Z690-A can be done: using DTS v1.1.0, manually.","title":"Initial Deployment"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/initial-deployment/#initial-deployment-using-dts","text":"Initial deployment for MSI PRO Z690-A (WIFI) (DDR4) is supported in DTS since version v1.1.0.

Summary for all 3 regions: Whole flash image To get the overall BIOS region and full image percentage of open source code we ignore unused space or FMAP regions which do not have CBFS and are merely data generated during build process or boot process. The BIOS region percentage is calculated as follows: (COREBOOT region open-source size + FW_MAIN_A/B open-source size * 2) * 100 divided by (COREBOOT region code size + FW_MAIN_A/B code size * 2) . Full image code only percentage is calculated as follows: (COREBOOT region open-source size + FW_MAIN_A/B open-source size * 2) * 100 divided by (ME + descriptor + COREBOOT region code size + FW_MAIN_A/B code size * 2) .

Without vboot, BIOS region free space would reach over 70%! While BIOS region's Dasharo Openness Score is 50%, when compared with Intel ME and descriptor, the overall Dasharo Openness Score is 38% ME share is different because the size of BIOS code is different on both distributions Summary Image Open-source percent (bytes) AMI BIOS 0% Dasharo 38% Dasharo code takes approximately 4MB of space for a single region + some space for data which is less than 1MB. This reduces the single copy of firmware from 8MB to roughly 4MB compared to AMI BIOS. This is roughly 50% reduction of TCB! More over, given the 50% share in size of open-source code, Dasharo liberates BIOS in 75%! Few conclusions: Although the reduction of TCB is 50% it cannot be seen on the charts due to 3 copies of the firmware in Dasharo image.

In such a case, the recovery procedure can reinstall the original firmware from the board manufacturer. There are two documented recovery methods: using a CH341A programming kit or an RTE . External flashing with programmer RTE In this case, using external programmer is necessary. We are using RTE here. Connect programmer to the flash chip as shown in the Hardware connection / SPI section of the Development documentation. Download official BIOS from vendor's website (this is the newest version, you may choose an older one too or in the best case use your firmware backup): wget https://download.msi.com/bos_exe/mb/7D25v13.zip unzip 7D25v13.zip Flash via external programmer: The command line will be different, depending on the programmer you use flashrom -p linux_spi:dev = /dev/spidev1.0,spispeed = 16000 -w 7D25v13/E7D25IMS.130 First boot after the recovery process is significantly longer CH341A Prerequisites The full set is now available at our online shop . CH341A kit with 1.8V level-shifter. Can be bought on e.g. Amazon WSON8 probe. Can be bought from China on Aliexpress or eBay. USB2.0 Female-Male extension cord 0.5m or longer (optional) Machine with Linux and flashrom. Connection First start with assembling the CH341A and the 1.8V adapter. Pay attention to which holes you attach the adapter. You should use the holes marked as 25XX (closer to the USB plug): Place the 1.8V adapter in the holes and lock it with the lever. Be sure that the arrow on the adapter is facing the black lever (opposite side of USB plug): Now take the breakout board with pin headers: and plug it into the other 1.8V adapter, be sure that numbers 1-4 on the breakout match the numbers 1 and 4 on the adapter: Numbers should be visible on the upper side after assembling: Next, take the WSON8 probe and locate the white dot on the needles side (it will indicate the first reference pin, although you may use any other corner pin): Check which wire is connecting to this pin (the connection should be 1 to 1). In my case it is white wire and it will be used as reference to connect the wires to the breakout board: The wires should follow the same order of colors as on the probe (keep them straight, and do not cross). Repeat with the other 4 wires on the other side of the probe: Now the connection is ready. Time to locate the flash chip of the board. Flashing Connect the CH341A USB plug to the host machine which will be doing the flashing process (optionally use the USB extension cord for convenience). Locate the flash chip on the MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4 board: Locate the first pin on the flash chip (marked with a circle on the flash chip package and indicated by number 1 printed on the board - red circle): Attach the WSON8 probe matching the first pin of the probe (white wire) and first pin of the flash chip: Now on the Linux machine check if the flash is detected using a sample command sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r firmware.bin You should see something like this: flashrom v1.2-567-gf4eb405 on Linux 5 .19.9-200.fc36.x86_64 ( x86_64 ) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops ( clk_id: 1 , resolution: 1ns ) . Found Winbond flash chip \"W25Q256.W\" ( 32768 kB, SPI ) on ch341a_spi. Reading flash... done . You don't need to wait for the command completion and interrupt it with Ctrl+C shortcut, it just serves as a confirmation of good connection. If you decide to interrupt it, reset the CH341A programmer by unpluging and repluging it to USB port. Now stabilize your hand holding the WSON8 probe on the flash chip and invoke the real flashing command (e.g. if your original/working firmware backup is saved as firmware_backup.bin ): sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w firmware_backup.bin Note that USB programmers are pretty slow, the whole operation make take several minutes (can be 10-15 minutes in worst case). At the end of operation you should see: flashrom v1.2-567-gf4eb405 on Linux 5 .19.9-200.fc36.x86_64 ( x86_64 ) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops ( clk_id: 1 , resolution: 1ns ) . Found Winbond flash chip \"W25Q256.W\" ( 32768 kB, SPI ) on ch341a_spi. Reading old flash chip contents... done . Erasing and writing flash chip... Erase/write done . Verifying flash... VERIFIED. MSI Flash BIOS Button The MSI Flash BIOS Button would give us easy-to-use recovery method. We have tried that one to switch from Dasharo firmware to the original one, but it did not work, unfortunately. The details of how this process exactly works are unknown due to the closed nature of it's implementation. We can research this topic more in the future, so maybe it can be utilized later for deployment and/or recovery of the platform. SMBIOS unique data recovery Serial number format and recovery SMBIOS specification sections 7.2 and 7.3 defines two spaces for serial number: the system serial number and baseboard serial number. The original MSI PRO Z690-A firmware provides only the baseboard serial number. In case you have lost your serial number in the process of flashing Dasharo or newer MSI firmware, there is a way to retrieve it. The board has a QR code printed on the mainboard between the chipset heatsink and dPGU PCIe slot: If you read the QR code with your smartphone you will get the full serial number. The serial number has the format 07D25xx_LyzEaaaaaa where: 07D25 - is the board model, i.e. MS-7D25 for this particular board xx is the mainboard revision which should match the revision imprinted between the M2_1 slot and dGPU slot. E.g. xx=11 means VER:1.1 yz is the manufacturing date in hex, i.e. y is the month, z is the year, for example A1 means October 202 1 , 12 means January 202 2 aaaaaa is the unique 6-digit number which is imprinted under the serial number QR code System UUID format and recovery SMBIOS specification section 7.2 defines a field for unique system identification with a special number called UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier). UUID is specified by RFC 4122 . MSI firmware provides the system UUID in the SMBIOS system information structure. The problem with UUID is that it cannot be recovered if the backup binary or SMBIOS logs are lost. You can backup the SMBIOS information with our Dasharo Tools Suite bootable stick . The dmidecode.log will have all the necessary information. Things we know about MSI system UUID: UUID format is as follows: 33221100-5544-7766-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF , the hex numbers represent the order of bytes in memory for the little-endian format as required by SMBIOS MSI UUIDs do not conform to any of the RFC 4122 UUID variants/versions (the bits responsible for UUID version and variant identification are not constant across multiple boards) the last octet group AABBCCDDEEFF is equal to the MAC address of the on-board Intel i225 Ethernet, so be sure to NOT share the UUID with anybody as it contains system sensitive information the first four groups are either random numbers or some cryptographically acquired value from e.g. combination of some board data, unfortunately it is not known by us The MAC address is printed on a sticker placed on the 2x2 SATA connector: SMBIOS data migration For Dasharo simply follow the Initial Deployment how to migrate the data. For MSI firmware you will probably need an AMI DMI/SMBIOS editor to save those values back if you do not have a backup binary.","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/recovery/#recovery","text":"","title":"Recovery"},{"location":"variants/msi_z690/recovery/#intro","text":"This project is in early development phase.

Touchpad hotkey enablement (Linux) The touchpad hotkey needs extra setup to function correctly under Linux. To enable the touchpad hotkey to work under Linux, follow the steps below: Create a file /etc/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb with the following contents: evdev:atkbd:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:svnNotebook:pnNS5x_NS7xPU:* KEYBOARD_KEY_f7 = 191 KEYBOARD_KEY_f8 = 191 Execute the following commands: sudo systemd-hwdb update sudo udevadm trigger After executing these steps, it should be possible to enable and disable the touchpad using the touchpad hotkey (Fn+F1) on the keyboard when using GNOME. Touchpad multi-touch support (NS7x / 17-inch model, Linux) On NS7x an additional fix is necessary to enable multi-touch on Linux. Create a file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-psmouse.conf with the following contents: blacklist psmouse and then run the following commands: sudo depmod -a sudo update-initramfs -u Now reboot your computer to apply the changes. Installing updates and drivers (Windows 11) Several features on Windows 11 (i. e. suspending the device) may not work or work unexpectedly without installing all of the updates and drivers. To install all of them, log into system, connect the device to the mains and Internet, then follow the steps below: Press the Windows button on the keypad. Type Windows Update Settings in the search and press Enter . Select the Check for updates bar to start installing available updates and drivers. During this process previously selected bar might be changed to Restart now or Retry , so click them if something hasn't been installed yet, something has gone wrong or restart is just required. The entire process may take up to 30 minutes. Select the Advanced options option in the Windows Update Settings window. Locate the Optional updates option and click on it.

It\u2019s the main tool used in Ubuntu Certification program. You can use this software without any modification to check if your system is behaving correctly or you can develop your own set of tests to check your needs. Checkbox optionally generates test reports in different formats (JSON, HTML, etc.) that can be used to easily share the results of a test session. Checkbox comparison - vendor firmware vs Dasharo Testing assumptions Tests have been conducted on the same OS version (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). Tests have been conducted on the same device, firstly with vendor firmware and secondly with Dasharo firmware (version 1.2.1). Test results Test results - vendor firmware: PASSED: 74, FAILED: 80, NOT SUPPORTED: 25. Test results - Dasharo firmware: PASSED: 74, FAILED: 80, NOT SUPPORTED: 25.

Device specification NovaCustom NV4x system firmware Intel i7-1165G7 (Tiger Lake ULV platform) Samsung 980PRO NVMe SSD 2x SO-DIMM DDR4 system memory Optional NVIDIA discrete graphics Dasharo coreboot-based firmware Firmware stored on a SPI flash chip, flashable internally via flashrom Update protocol The device is flashable internally via flashrom No special unlocks necessary for flashing the required BIOS flash portions (only requirement is that UEFI Secure Boot is disabled while updating) Feasibility analysis Tiger Lake-U is supported in flashrom Present since this commit , not yet released to stable as of 14.01.2022 flashrom is supported in fwupd flashrom plugin is enabled by default in many common desktop Linux distributions, including Ubuntu (starting with 21.10) and Arch Linux enabling a device in the flashrom plugin is a matter of adding device-specific entries to the plugin quirk list Potential risk: vboot support in fwupd flashrom supports flashing vboot rw slots, which are coreboot images located within the BIOS partition of the flash however, fwupd only implements flashing the entire BIOS region of the SPI flash, which includes other firmware components such as vboot keys, vboot recovery partition and user settings the device currently has vboot partially implemented - the BIOS flash is not protected and the binaries are signed with (public) developer keys this means we can currently update the BIOS using the traditional fwupd update path once we decide to change the vboot keys and lock down the rest of the, flash, proper vboot support will need to be implemented in fwupd until then, it will not be possible to enable vboot fully Further steps: Vboot support In case full vboot support in fwupd is desired, the following are currently missing and need to be implemented: Support reading and processing VBNV (Vboot non-volatile store) data in fwupd: this store contains information about the current vboot state, e.g. currently booted slot (A/B/Recovery), recovery reason, firmware signature verification status. This information is stored in CMOS, but the exact offset varies by device - so a method for determining the offset is also required. For Google Chromebooks, this offset is exposed in a Chromebook-specific ACPI device which we cannot use in non-Chromebook device. An alternative interface or possibly a quirk in fwupd's flashrom plugin will need to be added (though this approach is not preferred by fwupd maintainers). Support for flashing fmap regions in fwupd's flashrom plugin: currently, fwupd only attempts to read flash layout from the Intel Flash Descriptor located in the flash. This only allows fwupd to flash the entire BIOS region, while vboot requires only a portion of the BIOS partition to be updated at a given time, with some of the BIOS partition being read-only. This means that with vboot fully enabled, updating will fail by attempting to write to a read-only portion of the flash. Vboot partitions (slots) are a subset of the bios partition and are defined in FMAP (flashmap). Support for it will need to be implemented in fwupd (possible by utilizing libflashrom). Additionally, some user settings like boot order and setup options are stored in a separate FMAP region, so implementing FMAP support in fwupd will allow us to preserve them across firmware updates. Vboot A/B slot support In Google Chromebooks, the firmware updater only updates one slot at a time and if it succeeds (the device reboots into it successfully and works stably), then it will also update the other slot to the same (now confirmed good) firmware. fwupd does not currently support anything like this, so support for it will also need to be implemented.

We understand that many of you have eagerly awaited the next PC Engines firmware release. Rest assured that our commitment to supporting the PC Engines firmware remains strong, and we are working hard to bring you new features through the upcoming Dasharo firmware distribution. We appreciate your patience and continued support. We regret to inform the community that v4.17.0.3 was the last version of the firmware sponsored by PC Engines. However, 3mdeb has since released v4.19.0.1 , the final version delivered to the community using the existing model. As some may know, 3mdeb is a small open-source firmware consulting company based in Poland. Our team consists of passionate engineers and developers from open-source software, firmware, and hardware communities, frequent conference speakers, and people who love to tinker with bits. Every day we develop bleeding-edge low-level security solutions using top open-source frameworks. We are committed to continuing support and PC Engines hardware in the open-source firmware community but can't afford that on our dime. Since February 2016, we have made 87 binary releases for all PC Engines hardware platforms from apu1 through famous apu2 up to apu7. We published over 30k test results from our automated testing framework. Thanks to community feedback, we created extensive documentation . Our firmware development effort extended the lifetime value of PC Engines hardware. Most notable examples were: CPU Core Performance Boost feature enabling - blog DRAM Error Correction Code enabling - blog AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor enabling - issue tracker and many small things like a watchdog or SPI flash lockdown. According to PC Engines EOL statement apu2 / apu3 series availability will be: \"Based on an AMD embedded CPU, this platform should have good long term availability. This CPU should be available until 2024 according to AMD.\" We would like to continue support for PC Engines firmware through our Dasharo open-source firmware distribution. Further releases could include regular maintenance updates and new features such as UEFI compatibility, fwupd, Verified Boot, BIOS setup password, DMA protection, and more. For a complete list of planned enhancements, please visit the dasharo-issues repository on GitHub. Your support will play a crucial role in determining the roadmap and the speed of its implementation. We hope you will support our efforts to bring these new features and improvements to the PC Engines firmware. We are exploring the possibility of implementing a subscription model for firmware updates. We would like to hear from you to ensure that the pricing option is fair and reasonable for our community. We have created a survey to gather your thoughts and preferences on pricing. Your feedback is important to us and will help us make informed decisions about the future of our offerings.

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 22.04. Deploy using Dasharo Tools Suite For simplicity we recommend using Dasharo Tools Suite to omit all compilation steps and deploy the Dasharo firmware seamlessly. Be sure to disable the BIOS lock in the AMI firmware setup utility: Go to Chipset tab Enter PCH IO Configuration Disable BIOS Lock . Save changes and reset. Now you are ready to use Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS): Boot Dasharo Tools Suite. Perform Dasharo installation. This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). Disconnect the RTC/CMOS battery OR clear the CMOS using the pin header located near memory slots. Wait about 10 seconds and unshort the pins. Connect the power supply back. The platform should power on normally now. You can connect the battery back if it was disconnected. This concludes Dasharo deployment process using DTS. Build flashrom Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for Comet Lake U internal flashing. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from source. Install build dependencies: apt install git build-essential debhelper pkg-config libpci-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev meson Obtain source code: git clone https://github.com/Dasharo/flashrom -b dasharo-release cd flashrom Build flashrom: sudo make install Reading flash contents Always prepare a backup of the current firmware image. To read from the flash and save them to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom Keep the backup for later recovery if needed. Flashing Dasharo To flash Dasharo on the platform, execute the following command - replace [path] with the path to the Dasharo image you want to flash, e.g. protectli_vault_glk_v1.0.15.rom . If stock firmware is currently installed: flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] If Dasharo is currently installed, only the COREBOOT and IFWI partitions of the flash needs to be updated.

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 22.04. Deploy using Dasharo Tools Suite For simplicity we recommend using Dasharo Tools Suite to omit all compilation steps and deploy the Dasharo firmware seamlessly. Be sure to disable the BIOS lock in the AMI firmware setup utility: Go to Chipset tab Enter PCH IO Configuration Disable BIOS Lock . Save changes and reset. Now you are ready to use Dasharo Tools Suite (DTS): Boot Dasharo Tools Suite. Perform Dasharo installation. This will flash the full image, including the Intel ME. The operation requires a hard reset of the platform. To perform a hard reset: Power off the platform. Note, it may not power off completely due to flashed ME. Disconnect power supply from the board when OS finishes all tasks after power off (the screen goes dark or black). Disconnect the RTC/CMOS battery OR clear the CMOS using the pin header located near memory slots. Wait about 10 seconds and unshort the pins. Connect the power supply back. The platform should power on normally now. You can connect the battery back if it was disconnected. This concludes Dasharo deployment process using DTS. Build flashrom Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for Comet Lake U internal flashing. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from source.

Most notable examples of this hardware are X11SSH-TF and X11SSH-F . Ideal motherboard for NAS servers, with a PCIE x16 slot to potentially accommodate a graphics card. To learn more about our motivation for the coreboot port and Dasharo compatible with Supermicro X11 LGA1151 Series please check references section. If you want to build, initially deploy, update or recover your setup please check documentation sections on the left. Status Dasharo compatible with Supermicro X11 LGA1151 Series is a community-driven effort. We work on this in our free time, since we have no sponsor for this project. To address the issue we organize virtual hackathon on Dasharo Matrix whenever we can. At this point two communinty members are engaged ( collector-ynh with X11SSH-F and pietrushnic with X11SSH-TF, we also have X11SSH-TF in 3mdeb lab). Feel free to conact us if you wan to talk about project status. Please note that Dasharo compatilbe with Supermicro X11 LGA1151 Series may work with various boards from this family, at this stage only X11SSH-F and X11SSH-TF can be treated as tested. This state can change when we will enter more mature state with transparent validation results published in Releases section and hardware configuration matrix used for testing.

Testing firmware images without flashing BMC firmware v2.00+ allows testing new firmware images without flashing the physical flash device. This makes testing and switching between two versions (e.g. Hostboot and coreboot) much faster and safer. There are two ways of doing so, here's a more convenient one that uses mboxctl : Read original flash: For earlier versions of coreboot port it is required to read from system that booted at least once, since some of the partitions are modified on the first boot. this is no longer necessary since v0.5.0. root@talos:~# pflash -r /tmp/talos.pnor This file may also be copied out of BMC to a secure place and serve as a backup of whole flash contents. Keep in mind that tmpfs size is limited and exceeding that limit may result in unresponsive BMC, which in most severe cases requires hard power cycle. \"Flashing\" modified partition(s): This is similar to flashing real device with two changes: no need to erase the flash and target file must be specified. New command looks like this: root@talos:~# pflash -f -P <partition> -p <partition>.bin -F /tmp/talos.pnor Since the real flash device is not used, backup can be skipped. The rest is like above: # bootblock pflash -f -P HBB -p /tmp/bootblock.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor # coreboot pflash -f -P HBI -p /tmp/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc -F /tmp/talos.pnor # Heads pflash -f -P BOOTKERNEL -p /tmp/zImage.bundled -F /tmp/talos.pnor Mount the file as flash device: root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend file:/tmp/talos.pnor Sometimes this command fails with timeout, in that case repeat it until it succeeds. Optionally, success can be tested with: root@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state LPC Bus Maps: BMC Memory BMC Memory tells that emulated flash is used instead of real one. Host doesn't see any difference (except maybe different access times and erase block size), it still reads and writes PNOR the same way as with physical device. Start the platform as described in previous sections and test it. To get back to using real PNOR: root@talos:~# mboxctl --backend vpnor Failed to post message: Connection timed out root@talos:~# mboxctl --lpc-state LPC Bus Maps: Flash Device Even though that command reports failure, it maps LPC back to flash device. This can be tested with mboxctl --lpc-state . (Optional) Flash tested image to permanent storage: root@talos:~# pflash -E -p /tmp/talos.pnor The other method is described on Raptor's wiki and requires starting mboxd manually (still needs BMC firmware v2.00+).

This document describes the process of building, installing and running flashrom on Ubuntu 20.04. Build flashrom Currently, the latest flashrom release lacks support for Tiger Lake-U internal flashing. Because of this, we need to build flashrom from source. Install build dependencies: apt install git build-essential debhelper pkg-config libpci-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev meson Obtain source code: git clone https://review.coreboot.org/flashrom.git cd flashrom Build flashrom: make sudo make install Reading flash contents To read from the flash and save them to a file ( dump.rom ), execute the following command: flashrom -p internal -r dump.rom Installing Dasharo Initial Installation During initial installation of Dasharo, you should deploy supported Intel ME version (and configuration) on the device. Publicly released binaries do not contain ME binary. If you need an Intel ME update for your device, contact us via already established commercial support channel. When flashing binaries with ME binary included, flashing of the whole chip is required. Follow the steps below: Power off the laptop While holding the Fn+M keys, power on the laptop - This unlocks the ME and allows for it to be overwritten. The fans will spin at 100% speed at this point Execute the following command, replacing [path] with the path to the firmware image you want to flash, e.g. tuxedo_ibs15_full_v1.0.0.rom flashrom -p internal -w [ path ] Reboot the laptop The laptop will boot into Dasharo. After Dasharo has booted, it is safe to shut down the laptop to silence the fans Note: if you shut down the laptop instead of rebooting, it may be necessary to hold Fn+M for it to boot the first time after flashing. Updating Dasharo If Dasharo is currently installed, only the BIOS region of the flash needs to be updated. Flash it using the following command: # flashrom -p internal -w [path] --ifd -i bios","title":"Installation manual"},{"location":"variants/tuxedo_ibs15/installation/#dasharo-for-tuxedo-ibs15-gen6-installation-manual","text":"","title":"Dasharo for Tuxedo IBS15 Gen6 - Installation manual"},{"location":"variants/tuxedo_ibs15/installation/#intro","text":"Flashing coreboot can be done from Linux using flashrom with the internal programmer.
